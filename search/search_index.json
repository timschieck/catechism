corporate prayer before the sermon. This time is first and foremost an opportunity to continue worshipping God. Prayer acknowledges God\u2019s sovereignty over all things, it finds hope in the grace and mercy he offers though Jesus, it celebrates his faithfulness to give good gifts, and it rejoices in his loving attentiveness to his children.</p> <p>In the congregational setting prayer additionally becomes an opportunity to shepherd God\u2019s people. A well-formed public prayer can help the Christian learn how to pray. It can demonstrate the way in which scripture shapes our prayer and it can be an example for the rhythm and priorities of a scripturally informed prayer life.

Too much repetition of God\u2019s name (\u201cLord,\u201d \u201cFather,\u201d \u201cHeavenly Father,\u201d etc.) should also be diligently avoided. This is often simply a matter of habit and lack of forethought.</li> <li>A lack of order and certain important elements of prayer. Disorderliness is a distraction for people who are trying to pray along with the one leading in prayer.\u00a0</li> <li>Too much detail in particular elements of prayer. We should aim for proportion between the various parts of the prayer.</li> <li>Lack of a sense of occasion. Some prayers so disregard the circumstances of the service, that they are virtually generic and would be as suitable for one occasion as well as another. Public prayer ought to be fitted for and appropriate to the circumstances of the service in which it is rendered.</li> <li>Lack of reverence in the conclusion of prayer. Often the sentences or words of a prayer are spoken in such a way which gives the impression that the one praying is more concerned about what he must do following the prayer than he is with reverently addressing the Almighty. Our conclusions to prayer should be as worshipful as our beginnings.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"prayer/faults-and-strengths-of-public-prayer/#characteristics-of-a-good-public-prayer","title":"Characteristics of a Good Public Prayer","text":"<ol> <li>Public prayer should abound in the language of Scripture.\u00a0 This is \u201cone of the most essential excellencies in public prayer,\u201d said Miller. The language of the word of God is always right, safe, and edifying. Furthermore, in God\u2019s word there is a simplicity and tenderness which is very powerful and particularly suited to captivate the heart. Finally, it enables the listener to follow the prayer more easily.</li> <li>Public prayer should be well-ordered. Regular order is helpful to the memory of the one who is leading in prayer and assists the worshippers who are joining in it. Furthermore, it helps keep the prayer at a proper length. Of course, this does not mean that the same order must be used every time.</li> <li>It should be general and comprehensive. Miller observes that \u201ca suitable prayer in the public assembly is dignified and general in its plan, and comprehensive in its requests, without descending to too much detail.\u201d This will better suit the prayer to the general petitions that need to be rendered up by the congregation as a whole.</li> <li>It should not be too wordy or lengthy. This will involve care not to attempt to pray on too many topics, or in too great detail.</li> <li>It should be appropriate to the occasion on which it is offered. This is a Scriptural pattern, a help to the worshippers, and a good way to keep pastoral prayers from becoming too tedious or lengthy.</li> <li>It ought to contain a good dose of gospel truth. Without turning into a sermon, Miller suggests that \u201cIt is an important excellence in a public prayer that it include the recognition of so much gospel truth as to be richly in instructive to all who join in it, as well as who listen to it.\u201d</li> <li>It should manifest variety. There is so much that is suitable for inclusion in the petitions of corporate prayer in the Lord\u2019s church, that only laziness can lead us to pray over the same content, in the same pattern, week after week. A desirable degree of variety in prayer can be a great help to holding the attention of those worshippers who are seriously attempting to join in offering prayer to God.</li> <li>It should contain petition for the advance of the gospel. Miller says \u201ca good public prayer ought always to include a strongly marked reference to the spread of the gospel, and earnest petitions for the success of the means employed by the Church for that purpose.\u201d</li> <li>It should be marked by the spirit and language of hope and confidence. \u201cOur gracious covenant God loves to be taken at his word; to be firmly and affectionately trusted; to have his exceeding great and precious promises importunately pleaded; and to be approached as a willing, tender Father, not only \u2018mighty to save,\u2019 but ready and willing to save; more ready to bestow the gifts of his grace than earthly parents to give good things to their children\u201d said Miller.</li> <li>The voice and tone in which we offer prayer should be suitable to the solemn activity. \u201cIt is important to add, that the whole manner of uttering a public prayer should be in accordance with the humble, filial, affectionate, yet reverential spirit which ought to characterize the prayer itself throughout,\u201d said Miller. For a sinner to offer a prayer to Almighty God in a \u201cpompous, dictatorial manner\u201d is incongruous with our status as sinful men and the very activity of prayer (which is an acknowledgment of our creaturely dependence and an exercise of humble reliance).</li> </ol> <p>In conclusion, we may note Stephen Miller\u2019s pithy description of an acceptable public prayer. He said \u201cWords \u2018few,\u2019 \u2018well considered,\u2019 and \u2018well ordered,\u2019 are the inspired characteristics of a good prayer.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"prayer/kinds-of-prayer/","title":"What are the different kinds of prayer a church\u2019s gathering should include?","text":"<p>By 9Marks Q&amp;A</p> <p>In the Bible, we find prayers of praise to God, prayers of confession, prayers of thanksgiving, and prayers that lift up specific requests to God (Ps. 111; Ps. 51; 1 Cor. 11:24; Phil. 4:6). There\u2019s no verse which says that a church gathering must contain four distinct times of prayer, each of which covers one of these four different postures. But we believe it\u2019s prudent to do so for the sake of being deliberate about each, and for the sake of teaching the congregation how to do the same:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Prayer of praise. The Bible commands and invites us to praise God because of his greatness (Ps. 22:23, 29:2, 30:4). A prayer of praise praises God for who he is, as opposed to thanking him for what he does.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prayer of thanks. A prayer of thanks should offer thanks to God for all of the blessings he gives us, chiefly the spiritual blessings he gives us in Christ. Such a prayer is an appropriate way to preface a time of corporate giving.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prayer of confession. A prayer of confession should confess our sins to God in light of the Bible\u2019s commandments. Such a prayer should explicitly ask for forgiveness. It should be framed in terms that are broad enough to allow the entire congregation to pray along, yet specific enough to expose particular sins.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prayer of petition. A pastor should lead the congregation in praying for specific matters in the life of the church, the community, and around the world. Such a prayer may include intercession for members of the congregation who have particular burdens or opportunities, for important matters in the life of the church, for other local evangelical churches, for those in authority (1 Tim. 2:1-4), and for the spread of the gospel around the world.</p> </li> <li> <p>Prayer of lament See attached article.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The goal in all of these prayers is, first, to offer appropriate worship to God: God is worthy of our praise and thanks; we need to confess our sin to God; and God commands us to make our requests known to him. A second goal of these prayers is to teach the church how to pray. As they participate in these varied, corporate prayers every Sunday, the members of a local church will learn to pray deeply, broadly, and biblically.</p>"},{"location":"prayer/lament/","title":"Why We Added a Prayer of Lament to Our Sunday Gathering","text":"<p>By Neal Woollard for 9Marks</p> <p>The world is not as it should be\u2014and we feel it.

We yearn for Jesus\u2019 return to right all wrongs and renew our world, freeing us from the chaos and grief that accompanies deep suffering.</p> <p>But until that day, what do we do with our grief? What do we do right now while we\u2019re in the thick of it? We lament.</p>"},{"location":"prayer/lament/#what-is-lament","title":"What is Lament?","text":"<p>Lament is a biblical way to process grief. It gives us the opportunity to face and name our pain and then to create space for future hope\u2014all without glossing over tragedy. It allows us to cry and rage and even protest life\u2019s difficulties to God and others without fear of judgment. It gives us permission to ask How God? Why God? It\u2019s often raw and emotional. And that\u2019s okay. The Bible gives space for God\u2019s people to do this.</p>"},{"location":"prayer/lament/#lament-in-the-bible","title":"Lament in the Bible","text":"<p>In the Old Testament, almost a third of Israel\u2019s songbook is devoted to psalms of lament, both corporate and individual. Israel\u2019s wisdom literature offers the story of Job\u2019s honest protests to the Lord amid his tragedy. Lamentations is a tear-drenched book entirely dedicated to the cries of God\u2019s people as they process the greatest catastrophe in their history and ask for deliverance despite their sin.</p> <p>In the New Testament, we witness Jesus lamenting Jerusalem\u2019s future doom and then his own path of doom in the garden. We see missionaries like Paul crying over his lost brothers of Israel. Even in Revelation, the martyred saints cry out \u201cHow long, oh Lord?\u201d as they await their vindication. Lament is ingrained into the culture of Jesus\u2019 people and will be until he returns.</p>"},{"location":"prayer/lament/#lament-in-the-corporate-gatherings","title":"Lament in the Corporate Gatherings","text":"<p>That\u2019s why we recently added a corporate prayer of lament to our public worship. It\u2019s not a weekly dirge, but an honest, biblical cry we pray every few months to express our grief over the suffering in this world and in our lives. It\u2019s been invaluable. Here are four reasons why.</p> <p>1. Corporate lament creates space for grief. It\u2019s hard for the suffering soul to attend overly triumphant church services week in and week out. It\u2019s not that he or she doesn\u2019t believe in the triumphant work of Jesus, it\u2019s just that those services don\u2019t always give space for the emotions that the suffering saint is experiencing\u2014grief, confusion, anger, hurt, shame, and fear. Rather than rushing to a resolution, a prayer of lament allows us to slow down and journey through the honest pain. It also gives us an opportunity to bring our grief to God knowing that the God who receives our praise can also handle our protests.</p> <p>For example, this space gives voice to our mothers who miscarry and our members who have been abused. It tells those who struggle against mental illness, those whose new normal is anything but normal, that our church is a place for them. It protests wider tragedies like school shootings, mass refugee displacements, and destructive natural disasters. Through lament, sufferers are given a voice . They\u2019re both seen and heard.</p> <p>2. Corporate lament teaches us empathy. It\u2019s not just corporate worship that too often rushes past suffering; it\u2019s the congregation as well. We aren\u2019t sure what to do when someone voices anger at God or expresses profound sadness. It\u2019s uncomfortable. If we haven\u2019t gone through it we may not understand or even be okay with it. So we might tell the sufferer it\u2019s going to be okay, repeat a pithy saying we have heard, or quote a verse, and then offer to pray without ever listening. In the moment, this might pass as helpful, but over time, it can come off as trite and even careless.</p> <p>Lament teaches us how to mourn with those who mourn. It teaches us to listen and understand the depths of grief so that we can better bear one another\u2019s burdens. It grows our compassion and patience. Lament also teaches us how to pray alongside the grieving. We can sit alongside them and say, \u201cWe see you.\u201d This is powerful for the isolated griever.</p> <p>3. Corporate lament engages our emotions. Lament lets us voice how we feel despite what we know. And that\u2019s okay. The poetry of Lamentations isn\u2019t merely a historical retelling of Jerusalem\u2019s fall and Judah\u2019s demise. It portrays unfiltered, raw emotion that affected God\u2019s people at every level\u2014psychological, physical, spiritual, and relational.</p> <p>If the church isn\u2019t teaching us what to do with these emotions, then the world most certainly will. Thankfully, corporate lament teaches us to take the full range of our emotions to God. We don\u2019t have to pull ourselves together before we come to him. Rather than letting our emotions drive us where they want, we\u2019re using them to drive us to the Lord. God can handle our deepest emotions. After all, he \u201chas broad enough shoulders to cry on and a big enough chest to beat against\u201d (Christopher Wright, The Message of Lamentations, 78).</p> <p>4. Corporate lament places our trust in God. A lament is ultimately a prayer of faith. It acknowledges that God is in control and so we cry to him rather than run from him. As God\u2019s people, we know he has heard our cries because he sent his Son to die in our place. He has already removed the stain of sin from our hearts and given us spiritual life. And one day, he will remove the consequences of sin from this world and heal our broken bodies. Faith does not minimize our grief, but helps us place our trust in him even as we suffer in the here and now.</p> <p>Corporate lament teaches us to trust God amid pain, whether it\u2019s caused by our own sin, the sin of others, or the sinfulness of this world. We know one day he will remove all pain and evil and bring justice and renewal to his world. He will wipe away every tear and heal every wound. And so we take our pain to him now even as we trust that he will take it all away then.</p> <p>The end of every prayer of lament is the same: \u201cCome, Lord Jesus, come.\u201d</p>"},{"location":"music/themes/","title":"Themes","text":""},{"location":"music/themes/#adoration","title":"adoration","text":"<ul> <li>10,000 Reasons (Bless The Lord)</li> <li>All
