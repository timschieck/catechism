For all who are weary and in need of rest;
to all who mourn and long for comfort;
to all who feel lost and worthless and wonder if God even cares;
to all who fall and desire victory;
to all who sin and need a Saviour;
to all who hunger and thirst for righteousness;
And to whoever else will come,
This church opens wide her doors 
and offers welcome in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ 
the friend of sinners, 
the lover of his enemies, 
the defender of the weak, 
and the justifier of those who have no excuses left!
