The Protestant reformers of the sixteenth century taught the Church five "Solas" to proclaim, teach, and remind Christians of what God alone does and gives. They are: Sola Scriptura, Sola Gratia, Sola Fide, Sola Christus, Soli Deo Gloria. Let us affirm these powerful truths together: 

**Leader:**  
The Truth is found in *Sola Scriptura*, Scripture Alone.  
**All:**  
God's Word is the only inerrant, sufficient, and final authority for the church. 

**Leader:**  
Our salvation is in *Sola Gratia*, Grace Alone.  
**All**:  
Our salvation, from beginning to end, is solely by grace.  

**Leader:**  
Our reward in Christ is received by *Sola Fide*, Faith Alone.  
**All:**  
The redemption Christ has accomplished is received only by faith.  

**Leader:**  
Our hope is in *Solus Christus*, Christ Alone.  
**All:**  
The ungodly are justified in God's sight through Jesus' finished work. Christ is our only hope!

**Leader:**  
Our response to this gift of salvation is *Soli Deo Gloria*  
**All:**  
Glory to God alone!
