**Q.** Who is the Mediator, who is at the same time true God and a true, sinless Man?

**A.** Our Lord Jesus Christ, who is freely given to us for complete redemption and righteousness

## 19
**Q.** How do we know this? 

**A.** From the Holy Gospel: which God Himself first revealed in _Paradise;_ afterwards proclaimed by the holy _Patriarchs_ and _Prophets_, and foreshadowed by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law; and finally fulfilled by His beloved Son.

## 31
**Q.** Why is he called “Christ,” meaning “anointed”?

**A.** Because he has been ordained by God the Father and has been anointed with the Holy Spirit to be our chief prophet and teacher who fully reveals to us the secret counsel and will of God concerning our deliverance; our only high priest who has delivered us by the one sacrifice of his body, and who continually pleads our cause with the Father; and our eternal king who governs us by his Word and Spirit, and who guards us and keeps us in the freedom he has won for us.

## 51
Q. How does the glory of Christ, our Head, benefit us?
  
A. First, by His Holy Spirit He pours out heavenly gifts upon us, His members. Second, by His power He defends and preserves us against all enemies.

## 52
Q. What comfort is it to you that Christ will come to judge the living and the dead?

A. In all my sorrow and persecution I lift up my head and eagerly await as judge from heaven the very same person who before has submitted Himself to the judgment of God for my sake, and has removed all the curse from me. He will cast all His and my enemies into everlasting condemnation, but He will take me and all His chosen ones to Himself into heavenly joy and glory.

## 53
Q. What do you believe concerning the Holy Spirit?

A. First, He is, together with the Father and the Son, true and eternal God. Second, He is also given to me, to make me by true faith share in Christ and all His benefits, to comfort me, and to remain with me forever.

## 75
**Q.** How does the holy supper remind and assure you that you share in Christ’s one sacrifice on the cross and in all his benefits?

**A.** In this way: Christ has commanded me and all believers to eat this broken bread and to drink this cup in remembrance of him. With this command come these promises:^[Matt. 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-25]

First, as surely as I see with my eyes the bread of the Lord broken for me and the cup shared with me, so surely his body was offered and broken for me and his blood poured out for me on the cross.

Second, as surely as I receive from the hand of the one who serves, and taste with my mouth the bread and cup of the Lord,   given me as sure signs of Christ’s body and blood, so surely he nourishes and refreshes my soul for eternal life with his crucified body and poured-out blood.

## 81 
**Q.** Who should come to the Lord’s table?

**A.** Those who are displeased with themselves because of their sins, but who nevertheless trust that their sins are pardoned and that their remaining weakness is covered by the suffering and death of Christ, and who also desire more and more to strengthen their faith and to lead a better life.

Hypocrites and those who are unrepentant, however,  
eat and drink judgment on themselves.^[1 Cor. 10:19-22; 11:26-32]
