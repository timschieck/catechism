## The Occasion of Corporate Prayer
Most Sundays our worship service includes a corporate prayer before the sermon. This time is first and foremost an opportunity to continue worshipping God. Prayer acknowledges God’s sovereignty over all things, it finds hope in the grace and mercy he offers though Jesus, it celebrates his faithfulness to give good gifts, and it rejoices in his loving attentiveness to his children.

In the congregational setting prayer additionally becomes an opportunity to shepherd God’s people. A well-formed public prayer can help the Christian learn how to pray. It can demonstrate the way in which scripture shapes our prayer and it can be an example for the rhythm and priorities of a scripturally informed prayer life. The time of corporate prayer in our services is given priority both because of the way it honors and worships God and the way in which it helps form his people. 

## The Structure of Corporate Prayer
Often the prayer will follow the main portion of worship in music. The beginning of this time is a natural opportunity to offer a short pastoral word to the congregation. This is a moment to remind the congregation why we pray, what is happening when we pray, and how the Bible instructs us to pray. Even a few brief words before the prayer are a helpful way to teach and shepherd the congregation.

The prayer itself should last about 4-5 minutes (If typed out this will be about a half page single-space). It can be helpful to write out the prayer in its entirety or, if you are more comfortable an outline can be a useful tool. 

After the conclusion of the prayer there is often a verse read aloud. For prayers of adoration and confession this passage is an assurance of pardon that reminds the believer of God’s grace and mercy to forgive sins. For prayers of thanksgiving and supplication this passage is a reminder of God’s faithfulness to listen to the prayers of his children.
