Verse 1  
  
How rich a treasure we possess  
In Jesus Christ our Lord  
His blood our ransom and defense  
His glory our reward  
The sum of all created things  
Are worthless in compare  
For our inheritance is Him  
Whose praise angels declare  
  
Verse 2  
  
How free and costly was the love  
Displayed upon the cross  
While we were dead in untold sin  
The Sov'reign purchased us  
The will of God the Father  
Demonstrated through the Son  
The Spirit seals the greatest work  
The work which Christ has done  
  
Verse 3  
  
How vast and measureless the flood  
Of mercy unrestrained  
The penalty was paid in full  
The spotless Lamb was slain  
Salvation what a priceless gift  
Received by grace through faith  
We stand in robes of righteousness  
We stand in Jesus' Name  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Ending)  
For Yours is the Kingdom  
And the power and the glory  
Yours is the Kingdom and the power and the glory  
Yours is the Kingdom and the power and the glory  
Amen yeah amen amen
