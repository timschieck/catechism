    Verse 1  
  
Deliverer You brought us out of the miry clay  
You set our feet upon the rock  
And You made us say Holy is the Lord  
We would declare Your thoughts about us  
And one by one  
It'd be too many to count so we simply come  
And sing of Your great love  
So we sing  
We lift our hands and sing  
  
Chorus 1  
  
You are worthy of affection  
You're the radiance of all of His glory  
Let adoration fill this place  
You hold ev'rything together  
By the Word of Your immovable power  
We sing a song of praise  
(We sing) a song of praise)  
  
Verse 2  
  
We are the broken down and we are the beaten up  
But what can stop us from a song of unending love  
Holy is the Lord You are the treasure the hope  
The bright and morning star  
You are the lover of our soul  
And You've won our hearts  
We sing of Your great love  
So we sing we lift our hands and sing
