Verse 1  
  
We've waited for this day  
We're gathered in Your Name  
Calling out to You  
Your glory like a fire awakening desire  
Will burn our hearts with truth  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
You're the reason we're here  
You're the reason we're singing  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Open up the heavens we want to see You  
Open up the floodgates a mighty river  
Flowing from Your heart  
Filling every part of our praise  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Interlude)  
Oo oo oo oo oo  
  
Verse 2  
  
Your presence in this place Your glory on our face  
We're looking to the sky  
Descending like a cloud You're standing with us now  
Lord unveil our eyes  
  
Misc 3  
  
(Bridge)  
Show us show us Your glory  
Show us show us Your power  
Show us show us Your glory Lord  
  
Misc 4  
  
(Ending)  
Oo oo oo oo
