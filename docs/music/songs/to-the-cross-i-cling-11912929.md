Verse 1  
  
No day of my life has passed that has not proved  
Me guilty in Your sight  
The best I have to offer are these filthy rags  
Yet You love me  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
All things in me call for my rejection  
All things in You plead my acceptance  
  
Chorus 1  
  
I am guilty but pardoned  
By grace I've been set free  
I am ransomed through the blood You shed for me  
I was dead in my transgressions  
But life You brought to me  
I am reconciled through mercy  
To the cross I cling  
To the cross I cling  
  
Verse 2  
  
No more am I  
A slave to sin but bought with a price  
Redemption that was purchased  
Through the blessed cross  
That You bore for me  
You bore for me  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Interlude)  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh  
(REPEAT)
