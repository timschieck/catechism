    Verse 1  
  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord  
O sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble  
Were you there when they crucified my Lord  
  
Verse 2  
  
Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree  
Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree  
O sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble  
Were you there when they nailed Him to the tree  
  
Verse 3  
  
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb  
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb  
O sometimes it causes me to tremble tremble tremble  
Were you there when they laid Him in the tomb  
  
Verse 4  
  
Were you there when He rose up from the dead  
Were you there when He rose up from the dead  
O sometimes I feel like shouting glory glory glory  
Were you there when He rose up from the dead
