Verse 1

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
For I once was lost but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see
Hallelujah Christ is risen from the grave
Hallelujah Christ is risen from the grave

Verse 2

The prodigal is welcomed home
The sinner now a saint
For the God who died came back to life
And everything has changed
Hallelujah Christ is risen from the grave
Hallelujah Christ is risen from the grave

Misc 1

(Pre-Chorus)
O death where is your sting
O fear where is your power
The mighty King of kings has disarmed you
Delivered and redeemed eternal life is ours
O praise His name forever

Chorus 1

Hallelujah Christ is risen from the grave
Hallelujah Christ is risen from the grave
And all throughout eternity
Our song will be the same
Hallelujah Christ is risen from the grave

Verse 3

And on the day You call me in
To heaven's sweet embrace
I'll see Your scars Your open arms
The beauty of Your face
Through tears of joy
I'll lift my voice in everlasting praise
Hallelujah Christ is risen from the grave

Misc 2

(Vamp)
Jesus is alive oh
And all throughout eternity
Our song will be the same
Hallelujah Christ is risen from the grave
