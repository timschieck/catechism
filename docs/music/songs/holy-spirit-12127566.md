Verse 1

There's nothing worth more that will ever come close
No thing can compare You're our living hope
Your Presence

Verse 2

I've tasted and seen of the sweetest of loves
Where my heart becomes free and my shame is undone
In Your Presence Lord

Chorus 1

Holy Spirit You are welcome here
Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere
Your glory God is what our hearts long for
To be overcome by Your Presence Lord
(Your Presence Lord)
(Your Presence)
(Oh God how we love Your Presence Lord)

Misc 1

(Bridge)
Let us become more aware of Your Presence
Let us experience the glory of Your goodness (Lord)
