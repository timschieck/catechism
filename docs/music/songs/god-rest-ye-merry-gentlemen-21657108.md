    Verse 1  
  
God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our Saviour  
Was born on Christmas Day  
To save us all from Satan's pow'r  
When we were gone astray  
  
Chorus 1  
  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
O tidings of comfort and joy  
  
Verse 2  
  
In Bethlehem in Jewry  
This blessed Babe was born  
And laid within a manger  
Upon this blessed morn  
The which His mother Mary  
Did nothing take in scorn  
  
Verse 3  
  
From God our heavenly Father  
A blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The Son of God by name  
  
Verse 4  
  
Fear not then said the angel  
Let nothing you affright  
This day is born a Saviour  
Of a pure virgin bright  
To free all those who trust in Him  
From Satan's pow'r and might  
  
Verse 5  
  
The shepherds at those tidings  
Rejoiced much in mind  
And left their flocks afeeding  
In tempest storm and wind  
And went to Bethlehem straightway  
The blessed Babe to find  
  
Verse 6  
  
And when they came to Bethlehem  
Where our dear Saviour lay  
They found Him in a manger  
Where oxen feed on hay  
His mother Mary kneeling down  
Unto the Lord did pray  
  
Verse 7  
  
Now to the Lord sing praises  
All you within this place  
And with true love and brotherhood  
Each other now embrace  
This holy tide of Christmas  
All others doth deface
