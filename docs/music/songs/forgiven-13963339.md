Verse 1  
  
I'm the one who held the nail  
It was cold between my fingertips  
I've hidden in the garden  
I've denied You with my very lips  
God I fall down to my knees with a hammer in my hand  
You look at me arms open  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Forgiven forgiven  
Child there is freedom from all of it  
Say goodbye to ev'ry sin  
You are forgiven  
  
Verse 2  
  
I've done things I wish I hadn't done  
I've seen things I wish I hadn't seen  
Just the thought of Your amazing grace  
And I cry Jesus forgive me  
God I fall down to my knees with a hammer in my hand  
You look at me arms open  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
I could've been six feet under  
I could've been lost forever  
Yeah I should be in that fire  
But now there's fire inside of me  
Here I am a dead man walking  
No grave gonna hold God's people  
All the weight of all our evil  
Lifted away forever free  
Who could believe who could believe  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Forgiven forgiven  
You love me even when I don't deserve it  
Forgiven I'm forgiven  
Jesus Your blood makes me innocent  
So I will say goodbye to ev'ry sin  
I am forgiven
