Verse 1  
  
Angels from the realms of glory  
Wing your flight o'er all the earth  
Ye who sang creation's story  
Now proclaim Messiah's birth  
Come and worship  
Come and worship  
Worship Christ the newborn King  
  
Verse 2  
  
Shepherds in the field abiding  
Watching o'er your flocks by night  
God with man is now residing  
Yonder shines the infant light  
Come and worship  
Come and worship  
Worship Christ the newborn King

Emmanuel Emmanuel  
You are the God who saves us  
Worthy of all our praises

Come have Your way among us  
We welcome You here Lord Jesus  
Come have Your way among us  
We welcome You here Lord Jesus
