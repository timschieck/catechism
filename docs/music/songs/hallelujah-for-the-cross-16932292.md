Verse 1  
  
I would be hopeless without Your goodness  
I would be desp'rate without Your love  
Slave to the darkness  
If it wasn't for the cross  
  
Verse 2  
  
You have won me with Your kindness  
Chased me down when I was lost  
Where would I be  
If it wasn't for the cross  
  
Chorus 1  
  
(Oh) Hallelujah thank You Jesus  
I was a pris'ner now I'm not  
(Oh 'cause) With Your blood You bought my freedom  
(Oh) Hallelujah for the cross (oh)  
  
Verse 3  
  
All my shame was met with mercy  
Now Your mercy will be my song  
And oh the glory  
Oh the power of the cross  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
By Your stripes I'm healed  
By Your death I live  
The pow'r of sin overcome  
It is finished (it is done)  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Interlude)  
I thank You for the cross  
Jesus I thank You for the cross
