Verse 1  
  
You unravel me with a melody  
You surround me with a song  
Of deliverance from my enemies  
Till all my fears are gone  
  
Chorus 1  
  
I'm no longer a slave to fear  
I am a child of God  
I'm no longer a slave to fear  
I am a child of God  
  
Verse 2  
  
From my Mother's womb  
You have chosen me  
Love has called my name  
I've been born again into Your family  
Your blood flows through my veins  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
You split the sea so I could walk right through it  
My fears were drowned in perfect love  
You rescued me so I could stand and sing  
I am a child of God
