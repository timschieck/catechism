Verse 1  
  
Rumors of the Son of Man  
Stories of a Savior  
Holiness with human hands  
Treasure for the traitor  
No ear has heard no eye has seen  
The image of the Father  
Until heaven came to live with me  
A rescue like no other  
  
Chorus 1  
  
(Yes) You are worthy  
You are worthy of Your name  
You are worthy yes You are  
You are worthy of Your name Jesus  
  
Verse 2  
  
You did not speak You made no sound  
You died for Your accusers  
And as Your blood fell to the ground  
You redefined my future  
Yeah on the day that You arose  
The darkness ran for cover  
For the King of kings has claimed His throne  
Now until forever  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
You're my author my maker my ransom my Savior  
My refuge my hiding place  
You're my helper my healer my blessed Redeemer  
My answer my saving grace  
You're my hope in the shadows  
My strength in the battle  
My anchor for all my days  
And You stand by my side and You stood in my place  
Jesus no other name  
Only Jesus no other name  
  
Chorus 2  
  
You are worthy  
You are worthy of Your name  
You are worthy yeah  
You are worthy of Your name  
You are worthy  
You are worthy of Your name  
You are worthy yes You are  
You are worthy of Your name Jesus
