Verse 1

When my hope and strength is gone
You're the One who calls me on
You are the life
You are the fight that's in my soul

Verse 2

Oh Your resurrection pow'r
Burns like fire in my heart
When waters rise
I lift my eyes up to Your throne

Chorus 1

We are more than conquerors through Christ
You have overcome this world this life
We will not bow to sin or to shame
We are defiant in Your name
You are the fire that cannot be tamed
You are the power in our veins
Our Lord our God our conqueror

Verse 3

I will sing into the night
Christ is risen and on high
Greater is He
Living in me than in the world

Verse 4

No surrender no retreat
We are free and we're redeemed
We will declare
Over despair You are the hope

Misc 1

(Bridge)
Nothing is impossible
Ev'ry chain is breakable
With You we are victorious
You are stronger than our hearts
You are greater than the dark
With You we are victorious
