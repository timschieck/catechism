Verse 1  
  
O fount of love divine that flows  
From my Savior's bleeding side  
Where sinners trade their filthy rags  
For His righteousness applied  
Mercy cleansing ev'ry stain  
Now rushing o'er us like a flood  
There the wretch and vilest ones  
Stand adopted through His blood  
  
Verse 2  
  
O mount of grace to Thee we cling  
From the law hath set us free  
Once and for all on Calv'ry's hill  
Love and justice shall agree  
Praise the Lord the price is paid  
The curse defeated by the Lamb  
We who once were slaves by birth  
Sons and daughters now we stand  
  
Verse 3  
  
O well of joy is mine to drink  
For my Lord has conquered death  
Victorious forevermore  
The ancient foe is laid to rest  
Hallelujah Christ is King  
Alive and reigning on the throne  
Our tongues employed with hymns of praise  
Glory be to God alone  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Interlude)  
From Him through Him to Him be all praise
