Chorus 1

Come to the light 'tis shining for thee
Sweetly the light has dawned upon me
Once I was blinded but now I can see
The light of the world is Jesus

Verse 1

The whole world was lost
In the darkness of sin
The light of the world is Jesus
Like sunshine at noonday
His glory shone in
The light of the world is Jesus

Verse 2

No need for the sunlight
In heaven we're told
The light of the world is Jesus
The Lamb is the light
In the city of gold
The light of the world is Jesus

Misc 1

(Ending)
The light of the world is Jesus Jesus
