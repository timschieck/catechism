Verse 1

Joy has dawned upon the world
Promised from creation
God's salvation now unfurled
Hope for ev'ry nation
Not with fanfares from above
Not with scenes of glory
But a humble gift of love
Jesus born of Mary

Verse 2

Sounds of wonder fill the sky
With the songs of angels
As the mighty Prince of Life
Shelters in a stable
Hands that set each star in place
Shaped the earth in darkness
Cling now to a mother's breast
Vulnerable and helpless

Verse 3

Shepherds bow before the Lamb
Gazing at the glory
Gifts of men from distant lands
Prophesy the story
Gold a King is born today
Incense God is with us
Myrrh His death will make a way
By His blood He'll win us

Verse 4

Son of Adam Son of heaven
Given as a ransom
Reconciling God and man
Christ our mighty Champion
What a Savior what a Friend
What a glorious mystery
Once a babe in Bethlehem
Now the Lord of history
