Verse 1  
  
From Heaven's throne You came to us  
And set Your heart upon the cross  
We'll never know the sacrifice You made  
  
Verse 2  
  
For all our sin and all our shame  
You took the nails and took our place  
No one else could do what You have done  
  
Chorus 1  
  
One name is higher  
One name is stronger  
Than any grave than any throne  
Christ exalted over all  
  
Verse 3  
  
From the grave where death would die  
You rose again and brought us life  
You're reigning now the Savior of the world  
You're reigning now the Savior of the world  
  
Chorus 2  
  
The only Savior Jesus Messiah  
To You alone our praise belongs  
Christ exalted over all  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
We'll (We) sing Your praise  
Sing Your praise  
We sing Your praise forever  
And lift Your name  
We lift Your name  
Jesus over all
