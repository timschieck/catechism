Verse 1  
Who breaks the power of sin and darkness  
Whose love is mighty and so much stronger  
The King of glory the King above all kings  
  
Verse 2  
Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder  
And leaves us breathless in awe and wonder  
The King of glory the King above all kings  
  
Chorus  
This is amazing grace,  
This is unfailing love  
That You would take my place,  
That You would bear my cross  
You laid down Your life, that I would be set free  
Oh Jesus I sing for all that You've done for me

Verse 3  
Who brings our chaos back into order  
Who makes the orphan a son and daughter  
The King of glory the King of glory  
  
  
Verse 4  
Who rules the nations with truth and justice  
Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance  
The King of glory the King above all kings  
  
Bridge  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain  
Worthy is the King who conquered the grave  
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain  
Worthy, worthy, worthy
