Verse 1

I come God I come
Return to the Lord
The one who's broken
The one who's torn me apart
You struck down to bind me up
You say You do it all in love
That I might know You in Your suffering

Chorus 1

Though You slay me
Yet I will praise You
Though You take from me
I will bless Your name
Though You ruin me
Still I will worship
Sing a song to the one who's all I need

Verse 2

My heart and flesh may fail
The earth below give way
With my eyes with my eyes I'll see the Lord
Lifted high upon that day
Behold the Lamb that was slain
And I'll know every tear was worth it all

Misc 1

(Bridge)
Though tonight I'm crying out
Let this cup pass from me now
You're still more than I need
You're enough for me
You're enough for me

Misc 2

(Interlude)
Woah woah woah woah
Woah woah woah woah
(REPEAT)
