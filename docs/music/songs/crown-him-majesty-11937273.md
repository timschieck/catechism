Verse 1  
  
Crown Him with many crowns  
The Lamb upon His throne  
Hark how the heav'nly anthem drowns  
All music but its own  
Awake my soul and sing  
Of Him who died for me  
And hail Him as thy matchless King  
Through all eternity  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Majesty Lord of all  
Let ev'ry throne before Him fall  
The King of kings  
O come adore  
Our God who reigns forevermore (forevermore)  
  
Verse 2  
  
Crown Him the Lord of life  
Who triumphed o'er the grave  
And rose victorious in the strife  
For those He came to save  
His glories now we sing  
Who died and rose on high  
Who died eternal life to bring  
And lives that death may die  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
All hail Redeemer hail  
For He has died for me  
His praise and glory shall not fail  
Throughout eternity  
(REPEAT)  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Ending)  
Praise God who reigns forevermore  
You're the God who reigns forevermore
