    Verse 1  
  
Alone in my sorrow and dead in my sin  
Lost without hope with no place to begin  
Your love made a way to let mercy come in  
When death was arrested and my life began  
  
Verse 2  
  
Ash was redeemed only beauty remains  
My orphan heart was given a name  
My mourning grew quiet my feet rose to dance  
When death was arrested and my life began  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Oh Your grace so free washes over me  
You have made me new now life begins with You  
It's Your endless love pouring down on us  
You have made us new now life begins with You  
  
Verse 3  
  
Released from my chains I'm a pris'ner no more  
My shame was a ransom He faithfully bore  
He cancelled my debt and He called me His friend  
When death was arrested and my life began  
  
Verse 4  
  
Our Savior displayed on a criminal's cross  
Darkness rejoiced as though Heaven had lost  
But then Jesus arose with our freedom in hand  
That's when death was arrested and my life began  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Oh we're free free forever we're free  
Come join the song of all the redeemed  
Yes we're free free forever amen  
When death was arrested and my life began
