Verse 1  
  
Come ye sinners the poor and needy  
Weak and wounded sick and sore  
And Jesus ready stands to save you  
Full of pity love and power  
  
Chorus 1  
  
I will arise and go to Jesus  
He will embrace me in His arms  
In the arms of my dear Savior  
Oh there are ten thousand charms  
  
Verse 2  
  
Come ye thirsty come and welcome  
God's free bounty glorify  
True belief and true repentance  
Every grace that brings you nigh  
  
Verse 3  
  
Come ye weary heavy laden  
Lost and ruined by the fall  
If you tarry till you're better  
You will never come at all  
  
Verse 4  
  
Let not conscience make you linger  
Nor of fitness fondly dream  
He requireth  
Is to feel you rneed of him  
  
Chorus 2  
  
I will arise and go to Jesus  
He will embrace me in his arms  
In the arms of my dear savior  
O there are ten thousand charms  
  
Tag  
  
In the arms of my dear Savior  
O there are ten thousand charms
