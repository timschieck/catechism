Verse 1

You're the God of this city
You're the King of these people
You're the Lord of this nation
You are
You're the light in this darkness
You're the hope to the hopeless
You're the peace to the restless
You are

Misc 1

(Pre-Chorus)
There is no one like our God
There is no one like You God

Chorus 1

Greater things have yet to come
And greater things have still to be done
In this city
Greater things have yet to come
And greater things have still to be done here

Verse 2

You're the Lord of creation
The Creator of all things
You're the King above all kings
You are
You're the strength in the weakness
You're the love to the broken
You're the joy in the sadness
You are

Chorus 2

Greater things have yet to come
And greater things have still to be done
In this city
Where glory shines from hearts alive
With praise for You and love for You
In this city
Greater things have yet to come
And greater things have still to be done
In this city
Greater things have yet to come
And greater things have still to be done here

Misc 2

(Pre-Chorus)
There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God
There is no one like You God
There is no one like You God
