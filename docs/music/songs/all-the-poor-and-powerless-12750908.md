Verse 1  
  
All the poor and powerless  
And all the lost and lonely  
And all the thieves will come confess  
And know that You are holy  
And know that You are holy  
  
Chorus 1  
  
And all will sing out hallelujah  
And we will cry out hallelujah  
  
Verse 2  
  
All the hearts who are content  
And all who feel unworthy  
And all who hurt with nothin' left  
Will know that You are holy  
  
Misc 1

Shout it  
Go on and scream it from the mountains  
Go on and tell it to the masses  
That He is God (yeah)  
(REPEAT)  
  
Chorus 2  
  
We will sing out hallelujah  
And we will cry out hallelujah  
We will sing out hallelujah  
And shout yeah
