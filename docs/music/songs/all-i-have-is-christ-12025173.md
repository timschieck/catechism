VERSE 1  
I once was lost in darkest night  
Yet thought I knew the way  
The sin that promised joy and life  
Had led me to the grave  
I had no hope that You would own  
A rebel to Your will  
And if You had not loved me first  
I would refuse You still  
  
TURNAROUND  
  
VERSE 2  
But as I ran my hell-bound race  
Indifferent to the cost  
You looked upon my helpless state  
And led me to the cross  
And I beheld God's love displayed  
You suffered in my place  
You bore the wrath reserved for me  
Now all I know is grace  
  
  
CHORUS 1  
Hal-le-lu-jah all I have is Christ  
Hal-le-lu-jah Jesus is my life  
  
VERSE 3  
Now Lord I would be Yours alone  
And live so all might see  
The strength to follow Your commands  
Could never come from me  
O Father use my ransomed life  
In any way You choose  
And let my song forever be  
My only boast is You
