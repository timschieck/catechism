INTRO

VERSE 1
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' Name

CHORUS
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

TURN 1

VERSE 2
When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

TURN 2


VERSE 3
His oath His covenant His blood
Support me in the whelming flood
When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my Hope and Stay

TURN 3

VERSE 4
When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless to stand before the throne
