Verse 1

Come out of sadness from wherever you've been
Come broken-hearted let rescue begin
Come find your mercy O sinner come kneel
Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal

Chorus 1

(So) Lay down your burdens lay down your shame
All who are broken lift up your face
O wanderer come home
You're not too far
So lay down your hurt lay down your heart
Come as you are

Verse 2

There's hope for the hopeless
And all those who've strayed
Come sit at the table come taste the grace
There's rest for the weary
Rest that endures
Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't cure

Misc 1

(Bridge)
Come as you are
Fall in His arms
Come as you are

Verse 3

There's joy for the morning O sinner be still
Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal
Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal

Misc 2

(Ending)
Come as you are
Come as you are
Come as you are
