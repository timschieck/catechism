Verse 1  
  
Jesus shall reign where'er the sun  
Does His successive journeys run  
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore  
Till moons shall rise and set no more  
  
Verse 2  
  
To Him shall endless prayer be made  
And princes throng to crown His head  
His name like sweet perfume shall rise  
With every morning sacrifice  
  
Verse 3  
  
People and realms of every tongue  
Dwell on His love with sweetest song  
And infant voices shall proclaim  
Their early blessings on His name  
  
Verse 4  
  
Blessings abound wherever He reigns  
The prisoner leaps to lose His chains  
The weary find eternal rest  
And all the sons of want are blest  
  
Verse 5  
  
Let every creature rise and bring  
The highest honours to our King  
Angels descend with songs again  
And earth repeats the loud amen
