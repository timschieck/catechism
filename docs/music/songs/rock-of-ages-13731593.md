    VERSE 1  
Rock of Ages cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
Let the water and the blood  
From Thy wounded side which flowed  
Be of sin the double cure  
Save from wrath and make me pure  
  
VERSE 2  
Not the labors of my hands  
Can fulfill thy law's demands  
Could my zeal no respite D}know<br>Could my tears forever flow  
All for sin could not atone  
Thou must save and Thou alone  
  
  
VERSE 3  
Nothin hand I bring  
Simply to the cross I cling  
Naked come to Thee for dress  
Helpless look to Thee for grace  
Foul I to the fountain fly  
Wash me Savior or I die  
  
VERSE 4  
While I draw this fleeting breath  
When mine eyes shall close in death  
When I soar to worlds unD}known<br>See Thee on Thy judgment throne  
Rock of Ages cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee
