Verse 1  
  
Who am I that the highest King  
Would welcome me  
I was lost but He brought me in  
Oh His love for me  
Oh His love for me  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Who the Son sets free  
Oh is free indeed  
I'm a child of God  
Yes I am  
  
Verse 2  
  
Free at last  
He has ransomed me  
His grace runs deep  
While I was a slave to sin  
Jesus died for me  
Yes He died for me  
  
Chorus 2  
  
In my Father's house  
There's a place for me  
I'm a child of God  
Yes I am
