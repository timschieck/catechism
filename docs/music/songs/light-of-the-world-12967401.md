Verse 1

O Jesus Son of God
So full of grace and truth
The Father's saving Word
So wonderful are You

The angels longed to see
And prophets searched to find
The glory we have seen revealed

Chorus 1

Light of the world Light of the world
Light of the world You shine upon us
Light of the world Light of the world
Light of the world You shine upon us

Verse 2

You shone upon the earth
But who will understand
You came unto Your own
But who will recognise

Your birth was prophesied
For You were the Messiah
Who came and walked upon the earth
Your glory we have seen
The one and only King
And now You're living in our hearts

Verse 3

In You all things were made
And nothing without You
In heaven and on earth
All things are held in You

And yet You became flesh
Living as one of us
Under the shadow of the cross
Where through the blood You shed
You have made peace again
Peace for the world that God so loves
