    Verse 1  
A mighty for - tress is our God  
bul - wark nev - er fail - ing  
Our helper He a - mid the flood  
Of mor - tal ills pre - vail - ing  
  
For still our an - cient foe  
Doth seek to work us woe  
His craft and power are great  
And armed with cru - el hate  
On earth is not his e - qual  
  
Verse 2  
Did we in our own strength con - fide  
Our striv - ing would be los - ing  
Were not the right man on our side  
The man of God's own choos - ing  
  
Dost ask who that may be  
Christ Je - sus it is He  
Lord Sab - a - oth His name  
From age to age the same  
And He must win the bat - tle  
  
  
Verse 3  
And though this world with dev - ils filled  
Should threat - en to un - do us  
We will not fear for God hath willed  
His truth to  
tri - umph through us  
  
The prince of dark - ness grim  
We trem - ble not for him  
His rage we can en - dure  
For lo his doom is sure  
One lit - tle word  
shall fell him  
  
Verse 4  
That word a - bove all earth - ly pow'rs  
No thanks to them a - bid - eth  
The Spirit and the gifts are ours  
Through Him who with us sid - eth  
  
Let goods and kin - dred go  
This mor - tal life al - so  
The bod - y they may kill  
God's truth a - bid - eth still  
His king - dom is for - ev - er
