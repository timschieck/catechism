Verse 1  
  
Hark the herald angels sing  
Glory to the newborn King  
Peace on earth and mercy mild  
God and sinners reconciled  
Joyful all ye nations rise  
Join the triumph of the skies  
With th'angelic hosts proclaim  
Christ is born in Bethlehem  
Hark the herald angels sing  
Glory to the newborn King  
  
Verse 2  
  
Christ by highest heav'n adored  
Christ the everlasting Lord  
Late in time behold Him come  
Offspring of the Virgin's womb  
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see  
Hail th'incarnate Deity  
Pleased as man with men to dwell  
Jesus our Emmanuel  
Hark the herald angels sing  
Glory to the newborn King  
  
Verse 3  
  
Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace  
Hail the Sun of Righteousness  
Light and life to all He brings  
Ris'n with healing in His wings  
Mild He lays His glory by  
Born that man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth  
Born to give them second birth  
Hark the herald angels sing  
Glory to the newborn King  
  
Verse 4  
  
Come Desire of nations come  
Fix in us Thy humble home  
Rise the woman's conqu’ring seed  
Bruise in us the serpent's head  
Adam’s likeness now efface  
Stamp Thine image in its place  
Second Adam from above  
Reinstate us in Thy love  
Hark the herald angels sing  
Glory to the newborn King
