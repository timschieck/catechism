Verse 1  
  
Weep with me  
Lord will You weep with me  
I don't need answers  
All I need is to know that You care for me  
Hear my plea  
Are You even listening  
Lord I will wrestle with Your heart  
But I won't let You go  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
You know I believe  
Help my unbelief  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Yet I will praise You yet I will sing of Your name  
Here in the shadows here I will offer my praise  
What's true in the light is still true in the dark  
You're good and You're kind  
And You care for this heart  
Lord I believe that You weep with me  
  
Verse 2  
  
Part the seas  
Lord make a way for me  
Here in the midst of my lament I have faith  
Yes I still believe  
That You love me  
Your plans are to prosper me  
You're working everything for good  
Even when I can't see  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Bridge)  
Turn my lament into a love song  
(And) From this lament raise up an anthem (oh)  
  
Misc 3  
  
(Ending)  
Yeah You weep with me
