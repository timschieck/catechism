Verse 1  
  
Turn your ear to heaven  
And hear the noise inside  
The sound of angel's awe  
The sound of angel's songs  
And all this for a King  
We could join and sing  
All to Christ the King  
How constant how divine  
This song of ours will rise  
O how constant how divine  
This love of ours will rise will rise

Verse 2  
  
Turn your gaze to heaven  
And raise a joyous noise  
The sound of salvation come  
The sound of rescued ones  
And all this for a King  
Angels join to sing  
All for Christ the King  
How infinite and sweet  
This love so rescuing  
O how infinitely sweet  
This great love that has redeemed  
As one we sing

Alleluia alleluia  
He is holy
