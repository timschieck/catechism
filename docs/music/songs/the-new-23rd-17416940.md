Verse 1  
  
Because the Lord is my shepherd  
I have ev'rything that I need  
He lets me rest in meadows green  
And leads me beside the quiet stream  
He keeps on giving life to me  
And helps me to do  
What honors Him the most  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Even when walking  
Through the dark valley of death valley of death  
I will never be afraid  
For He is close beside me  
  
Verse 2  
  
Guarding guiding all the way  
He spreads a feast before me  
In the presence of my enemies  
He welcomes me as His special guest  
  
Chorus 1  
  
With blessing overflowing  
His goodness and unfailing kindness  
Shall be with me all of my life  
And afterwards I shall live with Him  
Forever forever in His home  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Ending)  
Forever in His home  
Forever in His home
