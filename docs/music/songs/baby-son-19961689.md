VERSE 1  
We thought You'd come with a crown of gold  
A string of pearls and a cashmere robe  
We thought You'd clinch an iron fist  
And rain like fire on the politics  
  
CHORUS  
But without a sword, no armored guard  
But common born in mother's arms  
The government now rests upon  
The shoulders of this Baby Son  
  
VERSE 2  
Have you no room inside your heart  
The inn is full, the out is dark  
But upon profane shines sacred sun  
Not ashamed to be one of us  
  
BRIDGE  
Gloria, Allelu  
Christ the Lord  
We've longed for You
