Verse 1  
  
There is no other so sure and steady  
My hope is held in Your hand  
When castles crumble and breath is fleeting  
Upon this rock I will stand  
Upon this rock I will stand  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Glory glory we have no other King  
But Jesus Lord of all  
We raise the anthem  
Our loudest praises ring  
We crown Him Lord of all  
  
Verse 2  
  
Your kindly rule has shattered and broken  
The curse of sin's tyranny  
My life is hidden 'neath Heaven's shadow  
Your crimson flood covers me  
Your crimson flood covers me  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
In all my sorrows Jesus is better  
Make my heart believe  
In ev'ry vict'ry Jesus is better  
Make my heart believe  
Than any comfort Jesus is better  
Make my heart believe  
More than all riches Jesus is better  
Make my heart believe  
And our souls declaring Jesus is better  
Make my heart believe  
And our song eternal Jesus is better  
Make my heart believe  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Glory glory we have no other King  
But Jesus Lord of all  
Glory glory we have no other King  
But Jesus Lord of all  
We raise the anthem  
Our loudest praises ring  
We crown Him Lord of all  
We crown Him Lord of all
