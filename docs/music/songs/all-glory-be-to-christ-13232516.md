VERSE 1  
  
Should nothing of our efforts stand  
No legacy survive  
Unless the Lord does raise the house in vain  
Its builders strive  
To you who boast tomorrow’s gain  
Tell me what is your life  
A mist that vanishes at dawn all glory be to Christ  
  
CHORUS 1  
All glory be to Christ our king  
All glory be to Christ  
His rule and reign we’ll ever sing  
All glory be to Christ  
  
VERSE 2  
His will be done His kingdom come  
On earth as is above  
Who is Himself our daily bread  
Praise Him the Lord of love  
Let living water satisfy the thirsty without price  
We’ll take a cup of kindness  
Yet all glory be to Christ  
  
  
CHORUS 2  
All glory be to Christ our king  
All glory be to Christ  
His rule and reign we’ll ever sing  
All glory be to Christ  
  
VERSE 3  
When on the day the great I Am  
The faithful and the true  
The Lamb who was for sinners slain  
Is making all things new  
Behold our God shall live with us  
And be our steadfast light  
And we shall ere his people be  
All glory be to Christ
