Verse 1  
  
God our Father full of power  
Maker of the heavens Maker of the world  
Forming all things seen and unseen  
Truly the Almighty beyond all measured worth  
Holy is His Name  
  
Chorus 1  
  
We believe the Lord our God is One  
Father Spirit Son this is our God  
We believe forever He will reign  
Let the church proclaim this is our God  
  
Verse 2  
  
Our Lord Jesus sent to save us  
Born unto a virgin lived a perfect life  
Greatly suffered dying for us  
From the grave He's risen seated now on high  
Holy is His Name  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Jesus will come back again  
To judge the living and the dead  
Usher in the age to come  
Let everyone sing amen  
  
Verse 3  
  
Spirit holy One in glory  
Speaking through the prophets empowering the Church  
Life is given by and through Him  
With the Son and Father worshiped and adored  
Holy is His Name
