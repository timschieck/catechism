    Verse 1  
  
There were walls between us  
By the cross You came and broke them down  
You broke them down  
And there were chains around us  
By Your grace we are no longer bound  
No longer bound  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
You called me out of the grave  
You called me into the light  
You called my name and then my heart came alive  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Your love is greater  
Your love is stronger  
Your love awakens awakens awakens me  
(REPEAT)  
  
Verse 2  
  
Feel the darkness shaking  
All the dead are coming back to life  
I'm back to life  
Hear the song awaken  
All creation singing we're alive  
'Cause You're alive  
  
Misc 2

And what a love we've found  
Death can't hold us down  
We shout it out  
We're alive 'cause You're alive
