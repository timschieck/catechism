Verse 1  
  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Verse 2  
  
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
Verse 3  
  
The Lord has promised good to me  
His Word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures  
  
Verse 4  
  
Through many dangers toils and snares  
I have already come  
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far  
And grace will lead me home  
  
Verse 5  
  
Yea when this flesh and heart shall fail  
And mortal life shall cease  
I shall possess within the veil  
A life of joy and peace  
  
Verse 6  
  
When we've been there ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
Than when we first begun
