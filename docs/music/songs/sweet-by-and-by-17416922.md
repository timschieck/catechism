Chorus 1

In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore

Verse 1

There's a land that is fairer than day
And by faith we can see it afar
For the Father waits over the way
To prepare us a dwelling place there

Verse 2

We shall sing on that beautiful shore
The melodious songs of the blest
And our spirits shall sorrow no more
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest

Verse 3

To our bountiful Father above
We will offer our tribute of praise
For the glorious gift of His love
And the blessings that hallow our days
