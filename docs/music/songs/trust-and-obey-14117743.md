Chorus 1  
  
Trust and obey  
For there's no other way  
To be happy in Jesus  
But to trust and obey  
  
Verse 1  
  
When we walk with the Lord  
In the light of His Word  
What a glory He sheds on our way  
While we do His good will  
He abides with us still  
And with all who will trust and obey  
  
Verse 2  
  
Not a shadow can rise  
Not a cloud in the skies  
But His smile quickly drives it away  
Not a doubt nor a fear  
Not a sigh nor a tear  
Can abide while we trust and obey  
  
Verse 3  
  
Then in fellowship sweet  
We will sit at His feet  
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way  
What He says we will do  
Where He sends we will go  
Never fear only trust and obey  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Ending)  
Trust and obey
