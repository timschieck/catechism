Chorus 1  
  
Trust and obey  
For there's no other way  
To be happy in Jesus  
But to trust and obey  
  
Verse 1  
  
When we walk with the Lord  
In the light of His Word  
What a glory He sheds on our way  
While we do His good will  
He abides with us still  
And with all who will trust and obey  
  
Verse 2  
  
Not a shadow can rise  
Not a cloud in the skies  
But His smile quickly drives it away  
Not a doubt nor a fear  
Not a sigh nor a tear  
Can abide while we trust and obey  
  
Verse 3  
  
Then in fellowship sweet  
We will sit at His feet  
Or weâ€™ll walk by His side in the way  
What He says we will do  
Where He sends we will go  
Never fear only trust and obey  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Ending)  
Trust and obey
