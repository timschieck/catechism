Verse 1  
Be still my soul the Lord is on your side  
Bear patiently the cross of grief or pain  
Leave to your God to order and provide  
In every change He will remain  
  
Verse 2  
Be still my soul your God will undertake  
To guide the future as in ages past  
Your hope your mind your will let nothing shake  
All now mysterious shall be bright  
  
Verse 3  
Be still my soul the hour is hastening on  
When we shall be forever with the Lord  
When disappointment grief and fear are gone  
Sorrow forgot love's joys restored  
  
Chorus  
Be still my soul  
Be still my soul
