Our Father everlasting
The all creating One
God Almighty
Through Your Holy Spirit
Conceiving Christ the Son
Jesus our Saviour

I believe in God our Father

Our God is three in One
I believe in the resurrection
That we will rise again
For I believe in the Name of Jesus

Our judge and our defender
Suffered and crucified
Forgiveness is in You
Descended into darkness
You rose in glorious life
Forever seated high

Chorus 2

I believe in life eternal
I believe in the virgin birth
I believe in the saints'communion
And in Your holy Church
I believe in the resurrection
When Jesus comes again
For I believe in the Name of Jesus
