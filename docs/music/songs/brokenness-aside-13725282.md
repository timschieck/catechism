Verse 1

Will Your grace run out if I let You down
'Cause all I know is how to run

Chorus 1

('Cause) I am a sinner
If it's not one thing it's another
Caught up in words tangled in lies (oh yeah)
But You are a Savior
And You take brokenness aside
And make it beautiful beautiful (oh yeah)

Verse 2

Will You call me child when I tell You lies
'Cause all I know is how to cry

Misc 1

(Bridge)
You make it beautiful You make it beautiful
You make it beautiful You make it beautiful

Misc 2

(Ending)
Oh You make it beautiful beautiful
Oh Lord You make it beautiful beautiful
