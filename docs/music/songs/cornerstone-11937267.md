Verse 1  
  
My hope is built on nothing less  
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness  
I dare not trust the sweetest frame  
But wholly trust in Jesus' Name  
(REPEAT)  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Christ alone cornerstone  
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love  
Through the storm He is Lord  
Lord of all  
  
Verse 2  
  
When darkness seems to hide His face  
I rest on His unchanging grace  
In every high and stormy gale  
My anchor holds within the veil  
My anchor holds within the veil  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Interlude)  
He is Lord Lord of all  
  
Verse 3  
  
When He shall come with trumpet sound  
Oh may I then in Him be found  
Dressed in His righteousness alone  
Faultless stand before the throne
