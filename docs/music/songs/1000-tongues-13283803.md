INTRO  
  
VERSE 1  
We are a sea of voices  
We are an ocean of Your praise  
Gathered under one name  
We are a tide that's rising  
And we cannot be contained  
Gathered under one name  
  
CHORUS  
O for a thousand tongues to sing  
The glories of our Lord God Almight-y  
O to sing the Savior's praise  
A triumph of His grace You are wor-thy  
(You are) (Yes You're so) wor-thy God  
  
INSTRUMENTAL 1  
  
  
VERSE 2  
We have found our anthem  
At the cross where sin was slain  
Gathered under one name  
Where every chain is broken  
And every sorrow swept away  
Gathered under one name  
  
INSTRUMENTAL 2  
  
BRIDGE  
With all Heaven sing  
And all earth below  
One Holy King  
One highest throne  
  
ENDING
