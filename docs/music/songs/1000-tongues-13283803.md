INTRO

VERSE 1
We are a sea of voices
We are an ocean of Your praise
Gathered under one name
We are a tide that's rising
And we cannot be contained
Gathered under one name

CHORUS
O for a thousand tongues to sing
The glories of our Lord God Almight-y
O to sing the Savior's praise
A triumph of His grace You are wor-thy
(You are) (Yes You're so) wor-thy God

INSTRUMENTAL 1


VERSE 2
We have found our anthem
At the cross where sin was slain
Gathered under one name
Where every chain is broken
And every sorrow swept away
Gathered under one name

INSTRUMENTAL 2

BRIDGE
With all Heaven sing
And all earth below
One Holy King
One highest throne

ENDING
