Verse 1  
  
He is jealous for me loves like a hurricane  
I am a tree bending beneath  
The weight of His wind and mercy  
When all of a sudden I am unaware of  
These afflictions eclipsed by glory  
I realize just how beautiful You are  
And how great Your affections are for me  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
Oh how He loves us so  
Oh how He loves us  
How He loves us so  
(REPEAT)  
  
Chorus 1  
  
(Yeah) He loves us  
Oh how He loves us  
Oh how He loves us  
Oh how He loves  
(REPEAT)  
  
Verse 2  
  
We are His portion and He is our prize  
Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes  
If grace is an ocean we're all sinking  
So Heaven meets earth  
Like a sloppy wet (unforeseen) kiss  
And my heart turns violently inside of my chest  
I don't have time to maintain these regrets  
When I think about the way that
