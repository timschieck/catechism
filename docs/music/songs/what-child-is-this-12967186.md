Verse 1  
  
What Child is this who laid to rest  
On Mary's lap is sleeping  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping  
  
Chorus 1  
  
This this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste haste to bring Him laud  
The Babe the Son of Mary  
  
Verse 2  
  
So bring Him incense gold and myrrh  
Come peasant king to own Him  
The King of kings salvation brings  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Raise raise a song on high  
The virgin sings her lullaby  
Joy joy for Christ is born  
The Babe the Son of Mary (Mary)  
  
Chorus 3  
  
Nails spears shall pierce Him through  
The cross He bore for me for you  
Hail hail the Word made flesh  
The Babe the Son of Mary
