    Verse 1  
  
My Jesus my Saviour  
Lord there is none like You  
All of my days I want to praise  
The wonders of Your mighty love  
My comfort my shelter  
Tower of refuge and strength  
Let every breath all that I am  
Never cease to worship You  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Shout to the Lord  
All the earth let us sing  
Power and majesty  
Praise to the King  
Mountains bow down  
And the seas will roar  
At the sound of Your name  
I sing for joy  
At the work of Your hands  
Forever I'll love You  
Forever I'll stand  
Nothing compares to the promise  
I have in You
