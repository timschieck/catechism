Verse 1  
  
Who else commands all the hosts of heaven  
Who else could make every king bow down  
Who else can whisper and darkness trembles  
Only a Holy God  
  
Verse 2  
  
What other beauty demands such praises  
What other splendour outshines the sun  
What other majesty rules with justice  
Only a Holy God  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Come and behold Him  
The One and the Only  
Cry out sing holy  
Forever a Holy God  
Come and worship the Holy God  
  
Verse 3  
  
What other glory consumes like fire  
What other power can raise the dead  
What other name remains undefeated  
Only a Holy God  
  
Verse 4  
  
Who else could rescue me from my failing  
Who else would offer His only Son  
Who else invites me to call Him Father  
Only a Holy God  
Only my Holy God
