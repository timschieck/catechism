Verse 1  
  
There is Love that came for us  
Humbled to a sinner's cross  
You broke my shame and sinfulness  
You rose again victorious  
  
Verse 2  
  
Faithfulness none can deny  
Through the storm and through the fire  
There is truth that sets me free  
Jesus Christ who lives in me  
  
Chorus 1  
  
You are stronger  
You are stronger  
Sin is broken  
You have saved me  
It is written  
Christ is risen  
Jesus You are Lord of all  
  
Verse 3  
  
No beginning and no end  
You're my hope and my defence  
You came to seek and save the lost  
You paid it all upon the cross  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
So let Your Name be lifted higher  
Be lifted higher  
Be lifted higher  
(REPEAT 4X)
