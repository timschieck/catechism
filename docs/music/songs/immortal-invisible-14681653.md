Verse 1  
  
Immortal invisible God only wise  
In light inaccessible  
Hid from our eyes  
Most blessed most glorious  
The Ancient of Days  
Almighty victorious  
Thy great name we praise  
  
Verse 2  
  
Unresting unhasting  
And silent as light  
Nor wanting nor wasting  
Thou rulest in might  
Thy justice like mountains  
High soaring above  
Thy clouds which are fountains  
Of goodness and love  
  
  
Verse 3  
  
To all life thou givest  
To both great and small  
In all life thou livest  
The true life of all  
We blossom and flourish  
As leaves on the tree  
And wither and perish  
But naught changeth thee  
  
Verse 4  
  
Great Father of glory  
Pure Father of light  
Thine angels adore thee  
All veiling their sight  
All praise we would render  
O help us to see  
'Tis only the splendor  
Of light hideth thee
