Verse 1

Immortal invisible God only wise
In light inaccessible
Hid from our eyes
Most blessed most glorious
The Ancient of Days
Almighty victorious
Thy great name we praise

Verse 2

Unresting unhasting
And silent as light
Nor wanting nor wasting
Thou rulest in might
Thy justice like mountains
High soaring above
Thy clouds which are fountains
Of goodness and love


Verse 3

To all life thou givest
To both great and small
In all life thou livest
The true life of all
We blossom and flourish
As leaves on the tree
And wither and perish
But naught changeth thee

Verse 4

Great Father of glory
Pure Father of light
Thine angels adore thee
All veiling their sight
All praise we would render
O help us to see
'Tis only the splendor
Of light hideth thee
