Chorus 1  
  
You my God have saved my soul  
I am Yours forevermore  
I won't be moved of this I'm sure  
You are my God and You saved my soul  
  
Verse 1  
  
I was lost when You came for me  
Held in chains by the enemy  
But You broke them in victory  
Now I'm free I am free  
  
Verse 2  
  
Youâ€™re my joy and You are my hope  
I am saved by Your grace alone  
I will sing of Your love for me  
I am free I am free  
  
Verse 3  
  
Now I stand with the Kings of kings  
He has paid for my every sin  
And from now through eternity  
I am free I am free  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
What once was dead is now alive  
You gave to me the breath of life  
You brought me up out from the grave  
I'm bursting out with songs of praise
