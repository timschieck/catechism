Intro  
  
Verse 1  
My hope is built on nothing less  
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness  
I dare not trust the sweetest frame  
But wholly lean on Jesus' Name  
  
Chorus  
On Christ the solid Rock I stand  
All other ground is sinking sand  
All other ground is sinking sand  
  
Verse 2  
When darkness veils His lovely face  
I rest on His unchanging grace  
In every high and stormy gale  
My anchor holds within the veil  
  
  
  
Verse 3  
His oath, His covenant, His blood  
Support me in the whelming flood  
When all around my soul gives way  
He then is all my Hope and Stay  
  
Verse 4  
When He shall come with trumpet sound  
Oh may I then in Him be found  
Dressed in His righteousness alone  
Faultless to stand before the throne
