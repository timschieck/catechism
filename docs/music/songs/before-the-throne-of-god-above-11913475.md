Verse 1
Before the throne of God a - bove
I have a strong and perfect plea
A great High Priest whose name is Love
Who ever lives and pleads for me

My name is grav - en on His hands
My name is writ - ten on His heart
I know that while in heav'n He stands
No tongue can bid me thence de - part
No tongue can bid me thence de - part

Verse 2
When Satan tempts me to de - spair
And tells me of the guilt with - in
Upward I look and see Him there
Who made an end to all my sin

Because the sin - less Saviour died
My sinful soul is counted free
For God the Just is satis - fied
To look on Him and par - don me
To look on Him and par - don me


Verse 3A
Behold Him there the risen Lamb
My perfect spotless righteous - ness
The great un - changea - ble I Am
The King of glory and of grace

Bridge
I see the light
I see the lightning
I hear your voice
Inside the cracking thunder
Singing

Nothing stands between us, oh
Nothing stands between us but love now
Nothing stands between us, oh
Nothing stands between us but love now
Nothing stands between us, oh
Nothing stands between us but love

Verse 3B
One with Him - self I cannot die
My soul is pur - chased with His blood
My life is hid with Christ on high
With Christ my Saviour and my God
With Christ my Saviour and my God
