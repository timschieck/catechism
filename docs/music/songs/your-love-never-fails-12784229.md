Verse 1

Nothing can separate
Even if I ran away
Your love never fails
I know I still make mistakes but
You have new mercies for me ev'ryday
Your love never fails

Chorus 1

(And) You stay the same through the ages
Your love never changes
There may be pain in the night
But joy comes in the morning
And when the oceans rage
I don't have to be afraid
Because I know that You love me
(Your love never fails)

Verse 2

The wind is strong and the water's deep
But I'm not alone here in these open seas
Your love never fails
The chasm is far too wide
I never thought I'd reach the other side
Your love never fails

Misc 1

(Bridge)
You make all things
Work together for my good
You make all things
Work together for my good
