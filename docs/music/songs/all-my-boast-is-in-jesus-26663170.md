    Intro  
  
Verse 1  
What wonder of wonders, what love is this  
That Christ would die for me  
His goodness, His merit, His righteous - ness  
This sinner’s only plea  
O foolish pride, be crucified  
The work is fin - ished  
  
Chorus 1a  
All my boast is in Je - sus  
All my hope is His love  
And I will glory for - ev - er  
In what the cross has done  
  
Verse 2  
Now fully forgiven, my life is filled  
With graces unde - served  
For mercy that flowed down that sacred hill  
Let praises now re - turn  
Rise up my soul and bless the Lord  
Who else is wor - thy (To Chorus 1a)  
  
  
Bridge  
O praise the One, for - ever blessed  
Him a - lone my heart a - dores  
And I will boast in noth - ing less  
Than the love of Christ, my Lord  
  
Verse 3  
I boast not in riches, in strength or might  
But in the grace of God  
I glory in weakness, to live is Christ  
In plenty or in want  
That I may know, that all may see  
His pow’r with - in me  
  
Chorus 1b  
All my boast is in Jesus  
All my hope is His love  
And I will glory for - ev - er  
In what the cross has done  
  
Chorus 2  
Now I stand in His free - dom  
Ransomed clean in His sight  
And I can - not be a - shamed for  
My boast is Jesus Christ  
My boast is Jesus Christ  
Forever my boast is Jesus Christ
