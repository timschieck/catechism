Intro

Verse 1
We won't fear the battle, we won't fear the night
We will walk the Valley with you by our side
You will go before us, You will lead the way
We have found a refuge, only You can save

Chorus 1
Sing with joy now; our God is for us
The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
Raise your voice now, no love is greater
Who can stand a - gainst us if our God is for us?

Verse 2
Even when I stumble, even when I fall
Even when I turn back, still Your love is sure
You will not abandon, You will not for - sake
You will cheer me onward with never-ending grace (To Chorus 1a)

Bridge
Neither height nor depth can separate us
Hell and death will not defeat us
He who gave His Son to free us
Holds me in His love
