Verse 1

You are a refuge
You have no borders
When I was a stranger
Knocking at Your door
You took me in

Verse 2

With no questions
And no conditions
When I was a sinner
Running from Your grace
You called me friend

Chorus 1

('Cause) There are no outsiders to Your love
We are all welcome there's grace enough
When I have wandered Lord
Your cross is the open door
There are no outsiders
I'm not an outsider (to Your love)

Verse 3

You are the harbour
In every tempest
When my soul was shipwrecked
Tossed upon the waves
You calmed the storm

Verse 4

You are the Father
There are no orphans
Every tribe and nation
Gathered in Your arms
Sings with one voice
Sing with one voice

Misc 1

(Bridge)
I was tired I was poor
I was thrown upon Your shores
I was homeless and afraid
'Til I heard You call my name
And now I'm ransomed I'm restored
Resurrected I am Yours
I am loved yes I belong
Oh my soul has found its home

Misc 2

(Ending)
No there are no outsiders
No I'm not an outsider to Your love
