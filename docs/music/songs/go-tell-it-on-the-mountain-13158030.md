Chorus 1  
  
Go tell it on the mountain  
Over the hills and ev'rywhere  
Go tell it on the mountain  
That Jesus Christ is born  
  
Verse 1  
  
While shepherds kept their watching  
O'er silent flocks by night  
Behold throughout the heavens  
There shone a holy light  
  
Verse 2  
  
The shepherds feared and trembled  
When lo above the earth  
Rang out the angel chorus  
That hailed the Savior's birth  
  
Verse 3  
  
Down in a lowly manger  
The humble Christ was born  
And God sent us salvation  
That blessed Christmas morn
