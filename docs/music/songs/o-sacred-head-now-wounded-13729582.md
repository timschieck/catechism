Verse 1  
  
O sacred head now wounded  
With grief and shame weighed down  
Now scornfully surrounded  
By hateful mocking crowds  
You look so pale with anguish  
With pain abuse and scorn  
Your body bruised and languished  
Your head is crowned with thorns  
  
Verse 2  
  
What language shall I borrow  
To thank my dearest friend  
For this Your dying sorrow  
For taking all my sin  
Oh make me Yours forever  
And cause my heart to be  
Surrounded in the shade of  
The cross of Calvary
