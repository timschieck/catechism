Verse 1

Go on and speak against my borrowed innocence
The judge is my defense
I'm going free
Right when the gavel fell
I heard the freedom bell
Ring through the heart of hell
I'm going free
I'm going free

Chorus 1

Glory glory hallelujah
You threw my shackles in the sea
Glory glory hallelujah
Jesus is my liberty
(I'm going free)

Misc 1

(Interlude)
Oh (oh)

Verse 2

I won't go back again that's just not who I am
Lord I'm a brand new man
I'm going free
I'm on a narrow road
It's paved with grace and hope
It's gonna lead me home
I'm going free
I'm going free yeah

Misc 2

(Bridge)
I am free I am free indeed
I am free I am free indeed
We are free free indeed
We are free free indeed

Misc 3

(Interlude)
Whoa we are free free indeed

Verse 3

Someday I'll fly away on Your amazing grace
Your love is my jailbreak
I'm going free
One two three sing
