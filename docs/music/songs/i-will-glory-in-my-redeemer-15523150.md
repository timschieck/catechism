    Verse 1  
  
I will glory in my Redeemer  
Whose priceless blood has ransomed me  
Mine was the sin that drove the bitter nails  
And hung Him on that judgment tree  
I will glory in my Redeemer  
Who crushed the power of sin and death  
My only Savior before the holy Judge  
The Lamb Who is my righteousness  
The Lamb Who is my righteousness  
  
Verse 2  
  
I will glory in my Redeemer  
My life He bought my love He owns  
I have no longings for another  
I'm satisfied in Him alone  
I will glory in my Redeemer  
His faithfulness my standing place  
Though foes are mighty and rush up on me  
My feet are firm held by His grace  
My feet are firm held by His grace  
  
Verse 3  
  
I will glory in my Redeemer  
Who carries me on eagle's wings  
He crowns my life with loving kindness  
His triumph song I'll ever sing  
I will glory in my Redeemer  
Who waits for me at gates of gold  
And when He calls me it will be paradise  
His face forever to behold  
His face forever to behold
