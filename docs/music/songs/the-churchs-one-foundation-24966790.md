Verse 1
The Church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord
She is His new creation
By Spirit and the Word

From heaven He came and sought her
To be His holy bride
With His own blood He bought her
And for her life he died

Verse 2
Elect from every nation
Yet one o'er all the earth
Her charter of salvation
One Lord one faith one birth

One holy name she blesses
Partakes one holy food
And to one hope she presses
With every grace endued.


Verse 3
'Mid toil and tribulation
And tumult of her war
She awaits the consummation
Of peace forevermore

Till with the vision glorious
Her longing eyes are blest
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the Church at rest.

Verse 4
Yet she on earth hath union
With God the Three in One
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won

O happy ones and holy
Lord, give us grace that we
Like them the meek and lowly
On high may dwell with Thee.
