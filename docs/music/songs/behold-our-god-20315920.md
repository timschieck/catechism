Intro  
  
Verse 1  
Who has held the oceans in His hands?  
Who has numbered every grain of sand?  
Kings and nations tremble at His voice  
All creation rises to rejoice (intro)  
  
Verse 2  
Who has given counsel to the Lord?  
Who can question any of His words?  
Who can teach the one who knows all things?  
Who can fathom all his wondrous deeds?

Chorus  
Behold our God seated on His throne, come let us adore Him  
Behold our King, nothing can compare, come let us adore Him!  
  
Verse 3  
Who has felt the nails upon His hands  
Bearing all the guilt of sinful man?  
God eternal, humbled to the grave  
Jesus, Savior, risen now to reign  
  
Bridge  
You will reign forever! (Let your glory fill the earth)  
You will reign forever! (Let your glory fill the earth)  
You will reign forever! (Let your glory fill)  
You will reign forever! (Let your glory fill)
