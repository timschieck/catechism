Verse 1  
  
Lord I come I confess  
Bowing here I find my rest  
And without You I fall apart  
You're the one that guides my heart  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Lord I need You oh I need You  
Ev'ry hour I need You  
My one defense my righteousness  
Oh God how I need You  
  
Verse 2  
  
Where sin runs deep Your grace is more  
Where grace is found is where You are  
And where You are Lord I am free  
Holiness is Christ in me  
Where You are Lord I am free  
Holiness is Christ in me  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
So teach my song to rise to You  
When temptation comes my way  
And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You  
Jesus You're my hope and stay  
And when I cannot stand I'll fall on You  
Jesus You're my hope and stay  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Lord I need You oh I need You  
Ev'ry hour I need You  
My one defense my righteousness  
Oh God how I need You  
My one defense my righteousness  
Oh God how I need You
