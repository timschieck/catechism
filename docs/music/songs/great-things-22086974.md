Verse 1  
  
Come let us worship our King  
Come let us bow at His feet  
He has done great things  
See what our Savior has done  
See how His love overcomes  
He has done great things  
He has done great things  
  
Chorus 1  
  
O Hero of Heaven You conquered the grave  
You free every captive and break every chain  
O God You have done great things  
We dance in Your freedom awake and alive  
O Jesus our Savior Your name lifted high  
O God You have done great things  
  
Verse 2  
  
You’ve been faithful through every storm  
You’ll be faithful forevermore  
You have done great things  
And I know You will do it again  
For Your promise is yes and amen  
You will do great things  
God You do great things
