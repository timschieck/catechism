    Verse 1  
  
The moon and stars they wept  
The morning sun was dead  
The Savior of the world was fallen  
His body on the cross  
His blood poured out for us  
The weight of every curse upon Him  
  
Verse 2  
  
One final breath He gave  
As heaven looked away  
The Son of God was laid in darkness  
A battle in the grave  
The war on death was waged  
The power of hell forever broken  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
The ground began to shake  
The stone was rolled away  
His (perfect) (reckless) love could not be overcome  
Now death where is your sting  
Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Now forever He is glorified  
Forever He is lifted high  
And forever He is risen  
He is alive and He is alive  
(REPEAT)  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Bridge)  
We sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah  
We sing hallelujah the Lamb has overcome  
(REPEAT)  
We sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah  
We sing hallelujah  
  
Misc 3  
  
(Ending)  
And now death where is your sting  
Our resurrected King has overcome  
He's overcome oh
