    Verse 1  
  
Ev’ryone needs compassion  
Love that's never failing  
Let mercy fall on me  
Ev’ryone needs forgiveness  
The kindness of a Saviour  
The hope of nations  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Saviour He can move the mountains  
My God is mighty to save  
He is mighty to save  
Forever Author of salvation  
He rose and conquered the grave  
Jesus conquered the grave  
  
Verse 2  
  
So take me as You find me  
All my fears and failures  
Fill my life again  
I give my life to follow  
Ev’rything I believe in  
Now I surrender  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Shine your light and let the whole world see  
We're singing  
For the glory of the risen King  
Jesus  
Shine your light and let the whole world see  
We're singing  
For the glory of the risen King
