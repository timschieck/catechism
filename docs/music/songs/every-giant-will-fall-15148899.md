    Verse 1  
  
I can see the promised land  
Though there's pain within the plan  
There is victory in the end  
Your love is my battle cry  
  
Verse 2  
  
When my fears like Jericho  
Build their walls around my soul  
When my heart is overthrown  
Your love is my battle cry  
The anthem for all my life  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Every giant will fall the mountains will move  
Every chain of the past You've broken in two  
Over fear over lies we're singing the truth  
That nothing is impossible (with You)  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Interlude)  
Whoah (whoah)  
  
Verse 3  
  
There is hope within the fight  
In the wars that wage inside  
Though the shadows steal the light  
Your love is my battle cry  
The anthem for all my life  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Bridge)  
No greater name  
No higher name  
No stronger name  
Than Jesus  
You overcame  
Broke every chain  
Forever reign  
King Jesus  
  
Misc 3  
  
(Ending)  
Oh nothing is impossible
