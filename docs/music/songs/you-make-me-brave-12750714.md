Verse 1

I stand before You now
The greatness of Your renown
I have heard of the majesty and wonder of You
King of Heaven in humility I bow

Chorus 1

As (to) Your love in wave after wave
Crashes over me crashes over me
For You are for us You are not against us
Champion of Heaven
You made a way for all to enter in (to Your love)

Verse 2

I have heard You calling my name
I have heard the song of love that You sing
So I will let You draw me out beyond the shore
Into Your grace

You make me brave

You make me brave
No fear can hinder now the Love that made a way

Because of love in wave after wave
Crashes over me crashes over me
For You are for us You are not against us
