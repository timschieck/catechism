    Verse 1  
  
'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus  
Just to take Him at His word  
Just to rest upon His promise  
Just to know thus saith the Lord  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Jesus Jesus how I trust Him  
How I've proved Him o'er and o'er  
Jesus Jesus precious Jesus  
O for grace to trust Him more  
  
Verse 2  
  
O how sweet to trust in Jesus  
Just to trust His cleansing blood  
Just in simple faith to plunge me  
'Neath the healing cleansing flood  
  
Verse 3  
  
Yes 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus  
Just from sin and self to cease  
Just from Jesus simply taking  
Life and rest and joy and peace  
  
Verse 4  
  
I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee  
Precious Jesus Savior Friend  
And I know that Thou art with me  
Wilt be with me to the end
