Verse 1

Higher than the mountains that I face
Stronger than the power of the grave
Constant in the trial and the change
One thing remains
One thing remains

Misc 1

(Interlude)
Your love Your love Your love will never change

Chorus 1

Your love never fails
It never gives up
Never runs out on me
(REPEAT 3X)
Your love

Verse 2

On and on and on and on it goes
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I never ever have to be afraid
One thing remains
One thing remains

Misc 2

(Bridge)
In death in life I'm confident and
Cover'd by the power of Your great love
My debt is paid there's nothing that
Can separate my heart from Your great love
(REPEAT)

Misc 3

(Ending)
Your love
