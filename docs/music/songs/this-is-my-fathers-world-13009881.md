    VERSE 1  
This is my Father's world  
And to my listening ears  
All nature sings And round me rings  
The music of the spheres  
  
This is my Father's world  
I rest me in the thought  
Of rocks and tress of skies and seas  
His hand the wonders wrought  
  
VERSE 2  
This is my Father's world  
The birds their carols raise  
The morning light the lily white  
Declare their Maker's praise  
  
This is my Father's world  
He shines in all that's fair  
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass  
He speaks to me everywhere  
  
  
VERSE 3  
This is my Father's world  
O let me ne'er forget  
That though the wrong seems oft so strong  
God is the Ruler yet  
  
This is my Father's world  
Why should my heart by sad  
The Lord is king let the heavens ring  
God is the ruler yet  
  
TAG  
This is my Father's world  
Why should my heart by sad  
The Lord is king let the heavens ring  
God is the ruler yet  
  
The Lord is king let the heavens ring  
God is the ruler yet
