    Verse 1  
  
This is my Father's world  
And to my list'ning ears  
All nature sings and 'round me rings  
Music of the spheres  
  
Chorus 1  
  
This is my Father's world  
I rest me in the thought  
Of rocks and trees of skies and seas  
His hand the wonders wrought  
  
Verse 2  
  
This is my Father's world  
The birds their carols raise  
The morning light the lily white  
Declare their Maker's praise  
  
Chorus 2  
  
This is my Father's world  
He shines in all that's fair  
In the rust'ling grass I hear Him pass  
He speaks to me ev'rywhere  
  
Verse 3  
  
This is my Father's world  
O let me ne'er forget  
And though the wrong seems oft so strong  
God is the Ruler yet  
And though the wrong seems oft so strong  
God is the Ruler yet  
  
Chorus 3  
  
This is my Father's world  
Why should my heart be sad  
The Lord is King let the heavens ring  
God reigns let the earth be glad  
The Lord is King let the heavens ring  
God reigns let the earth be glad  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
The Lord is King let the heavens ring  
The Lord is King let the heavens ring (3X)  
God reigns  
God reigns  
God reigns  
God reigns
