Verse 1  
  
He's coming on the clouds  
Kings and kingdoms will bow down  
And every chain will break  
As broken hearts declare His praise  
For who can stop the Lord almighty  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Our God is the Lion  
The Lion of Judah  
He's roaring with power  
And fighting our battles  
And every knee will bow before Him  
Our God is the Lamb  
The Lamb that was slain  
For the sin of the world  
His blood breaks the chains  
And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb  
Oh every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb  
  
Verse 2  
  
So open up the gates  
Make way before the King of kings  
Our God who comes to save  
Is here to set the captives free  
For who can stop the Lord almighty  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Who can stop the Lord almighty  
Who can stop the Lord (almighty)
