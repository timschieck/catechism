Verse 1  
  
I love You Lord  
Oh Your mercy never fails me  
All my days  
I've been held in Your hands  
From the moment that I wake up  
Until I lay my head  
I will sing of the goodness of God  
  
Chorus 1  
  
All my life You have been faithful  
All my life You have been so so good  
With every breath that I am able  
I will sing of the goodness of God  
  
Verse 2  
  
I love Your voice  
You have led me through the fire  
In darkest night  
You are close like no other  
I've known You as a father  
I've known You as a friend  
I have lived in the goodness of God  
  
Bridge 1  
  
Your goodness is running after  
It’s running after me  
Your goodness is running after  
It’s running after me  
With my life laid down  
I’m surrendered now  
I give You everything  
Your goodness is running after  
It's running after me
