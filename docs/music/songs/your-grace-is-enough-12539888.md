    Verse 1  
  
Great is Your faithfulness O God  
You wrestle with the sinner's restless heart  
You lead us by still waters into mercy  
And nothing can keep us apart  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
(So) remember Your people  
Remember Your children  
Remember Your promise O God  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Your grace is enough  
Your grace is enough  
Your grace is enough for me  
  
Verse 2  
  
Great is Your love and justice God of Jacob  
You use the weak to lead the strong  
You lead us in the song of Your salvation  
And all Your people sing along  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Yeah Your grace is enough  
Heaven reaches out to us  
Your grace is enough for me  
God I sing Your grace is enough  
I'm covered in Your love  
Your grace is enough for me for me
