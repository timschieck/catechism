Intro  
  
Verse 1  
What is our hope in life and death?  
Christ a - lone, Christ a - lone  
What is our only confi - dence?  
That our souls to Him be - long  
Who holds our days within His hand?  
What comes, a - part from His com - mand?  
And what will keep us to the end?  
The love of Christ,  
in which we stand  
  
Chorus  
O sing halle - lujah!  
Our hope springs e - ternal  
O sing halle - lujah  
Now and ever we con - fess  
Christ our hope in life and death  
  
Verse 2  
What truth can calm the troubled soul?  
God is good, God is good  
Where is His grace and goodness known?  
In our great Re - deemer's blood  
Who holds our faith when fears a - rise?  
Who stands a - bove the stormy trial?  
Who sends the waves that bring us nigh  
Un - to the shore,  
the rock of Christ?  
  
  
Verse 3  
Unto the grave, what will we sing?  
"Christ, He lives; Christ, He lives!"  
And what re - ward will heaven bring?  
Ever - lasting life with Him  
There we will rise to meet the Lord  
Then sin and death will be de - stroyed  
And we will feast in endless joy  
When Christ is ours for - ever - more
