    Verse 1  
  
Come and stand before your maker  
Full of wonder full of fear  
Come behold His power and glory  
Yet with confidence draw near  
For the one who holds the heavens  
And commands the stars above  
Is the God who bends to bless us  
With an unrelenting love  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Rejoice  
Come and lift your hands and raise your voice  
He is worthy of all praise  
Rejoice  
Sing the mercies of your King  
And with trembling rejoice  
  
Verse 2  
  
We are children of the promise  
The beloved of the Lord  
Won with everlasting kindness  
Bought with sacrificial blood  
Bringing reconciliation  
To a world that longs to know  
The affections of a father  
Who will never let them go  
  
Verse 3  
  
All our sickness all our sorrows  
Jesus carried up the hill  
He has walked this path before us  
He is walking with us still  
Turning tragedy to triumph  
Turning agony to praise  
There is blessing in the battle  
So take heart and stand amazed  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Rejoice  
When you cry to Him He hears your voice  
He will wipe away your tears  
Rejoice  
In the midst of suffering  
He will help you sing
