Verse 1  
  
When the music fades all is stripped away  
And I simply come  
Longing just to bring something that's of worth  
That will bless Your heart  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
I'll bring You more than a song  
For a song in itself is not what You have required  
You search much deeper within  
Through the way things appear  
You're looking into my heart  
  
Chorus 1  
  
I'm coming back to the heart of worship  
And it's all about You all about You Jesus  
I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it  
When it's all about You all about You Jesus  
  
Verse 2  
  
King of endless worth no one could express  
How much You deserve  
Though I'm weak and poor all I have is Yours  
Ev'ry single breath
