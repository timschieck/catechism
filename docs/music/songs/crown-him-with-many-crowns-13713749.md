Verse 1

Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for thee
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity

Verse 2

Crown Him the Son of God
Before the worlds began
And ye who tread where He hath trod
Crown Him the Son of Man
Who every grief hath known
That wrings the human breast
And takes and bears them for His own
That all in Him may rest

Verse 3

Crown Him the Lord of love
Behold His hands and side
Rich wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight
But downward bends each burning eye
At mysteries so bright

Verse 4

Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
And rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

Verse 5

Crown Him the Lord of lords
Who over all doth reign
Who once on earth the incarnate Word
For ransomed sinners slain
Now lives in realms of light
Where saints with angels sing
Their songs before Him day and night
Their God Redeemer King
