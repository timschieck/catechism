Verse 1  
  
Jesus let Your kingdom come here  
Let Your will be done here in us  
Jesus there is no one greater  
You alone are Savior show the world Your love  
  
Chorus 1  
  
King of heaven come down  
King of heaven come now  
Let Your glory reign shining like the day  
King of heaven come  
King of heaven rise up  
Who can stand against us  
You are strong to save in Your mighty name  
King of heaven come  
  
Verse 2  
  
We are children of Your mercy  
Rescued for Your glory  
We cry Jesus set our hearts towards You  
That ev'ry eye would see You lifted high

King of heaven come  
King of heaven come  
Oh King of heaven come
