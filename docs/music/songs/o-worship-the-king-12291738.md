Verse 1  
  
O worship the King all glorious above  
O gratefully sing His wonderful love  
Our Shield and Defender the Ancient of Days  
Pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise  
  
Verse 2  
  
O tell of His might O sing of His grace  
Whose robe is the light and canopy space  
His chariots of wrath the deep thunderclouds form  
And dark is His path on the wings of the storm  
  
Chorus 1  
  
You alone are the matchless King  
To You alone be all majesty  
Your glories and wonders  
What tongue can recite  
You breathe in the air  
You shine in the light  
  
Verse 3  
  
O measureless might ineffable love  
While angels delight to worship above  
Thy mercies how tender how firm to the end  
Our Maker Defender Redeemer and Friend  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Interlude)  
Shine in the light  
You shine in the light
