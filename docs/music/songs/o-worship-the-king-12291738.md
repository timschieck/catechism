    VERSE 1  
O worship the King all-glorious above  
And gratefully sing his wonderful love  
Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days  
Pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise  
  
VERSE 2  
O tell of his might O sing of his grace  
Whose robe is the light whose canopy space  
His chariots of wrath  
the deep thunderclouds form  
And dark is his path on the wings of the storm  
  
VERSE 3  
The earth with its store of wonders untold  
Almighty thy pow'r hath founded of old  
Hath stablished it fast by a changeless decree  
And round it hath cast like a mantel the sea  
  
  
VERSE 4  
Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite  
It breathes in the air it shines in the light'  
It streams from the hills it descends to the plain  
And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain  
  
VERSE 5  
Frail children of dust and feeble as frail  
In thee do we trust nor find thee to fail  
They mercies how tender how firm to the end  
Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer and Friend.
