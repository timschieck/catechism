Verse 1  
  
I've heard a thousand stories  
Of what they think You’re like  
But I've heard the tender whisper  
Of love in the dead of night  
You tell me that You’re pleased  
And that I'm never alone  
  
Chorus 1  
  
You're a Good Good Father  
It's who You are  
It's who You are  
It's who You are  
And I'm loved by You  
It's who I am  
It's who I am  
It's who I am  
  
Verse 2  
  
I've seen many searching for answers  
Far and wide  
But I know we're all searching for answers  
Only You provide  
Because You know just what we need  
Before we say a word  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
You are perfect in all of Your ways  
You are perfect in all of Your ways  
You are perfect in all of Your ways to us  
  
Verse 3  
  
Love so undeniable I can hardly speak  
Peace so unexplainable I can hardly think  
As You call me deeper still  
As You call me deeper still  
As You call me deeper still  
Into love love love
