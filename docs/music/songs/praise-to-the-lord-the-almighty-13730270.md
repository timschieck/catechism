Verse 1  
  
Praise to the Lord the Al - mighty the King of crea - tion  
O my soul praise Him  
for He is thy health and salva - tion  
All ye who hear now to His temple draw near  
Praise Him in glad ador - a - tion  
  
Verse 2  
Praise to the Lord Who o'er all things so wondrously reign -eth  
Shelters thee under His wings,  
yea, so gently sus - tain - eth  
Hast thou not seen how thy de - sires e'er have been  
Granted in what He or - dain - eth  
  
Verse 3  
  
Praise to the Lord Who doth prosper Thy work and defend thee  
Surely His goodness and mercy here daily attend thee  
Ponder anew what the Almighty can do  
If with His love He befriend thee  
  
Verse 6  
  
Praise to the Lord O let all that is in me adore Him  
All that hath life and breath  
Come now with praises before Him  
Let the amen sound from His people again  
Gladly for all we adore Him  
  
  
Verse 4  
  
Praise to the Lord Who  
When tempests their warfare are wa - ging  
Who when the elements madly around thee are ra - ging  
Biddeth them cease turneth their fury to peace  
Whirlwinds and waters assua - ging  
  
Verse 5  
  
Praise to the Lord Who  
When darkness of sin is aboun - ding  
Who when the godless do triumph  
All virtue confoun - ding  
Sheddeth His light chaseth the horrors of night  
Saints with His mercy surroun - ding
