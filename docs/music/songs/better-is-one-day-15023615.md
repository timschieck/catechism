Verse 1  
  
How lovely is Your dwelling place  
O Lord almighty  
For my soul longs and even faints for You  
For here my heart is satisfied  
Within Your presence  
I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Better is one day in Your house  
Better is one day in Your courts  
Than thousands elsewhere  
(Than thousands elsewhere)  
  
Verse 2  
  
One thing I ask and I would seek  
To see Your beauty  
To find You in the place  
Your glory dwells  
(REPEAT)  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
My heart and flesh cry out  
For You the living God  
Your Spirit's water to my soul  
I've tasted and I've seen  
Come once again to me  
I will draw near to You  
I will draw near to You to You  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Bridge)  
Better is one day better is one day  
Better is one day than thousands elsewhere  
Better is one day better is one day  
Better is one day than thousands elsewhere
