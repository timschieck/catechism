Verse 1  
Silent night holy night  
All is calm all is bright  
â€˜Round yon virgin mother and Child  
Holy Infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Verse 2  
Silent night holy night  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Glories stream from heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia  
Christ the Savior is born  
Christ the Savior is born  
  
Verse 3  
Silent night holy night  
Son of God love's pure light  
Radiant beams from Thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus Lord at Thy birth  
Jesus Lord at Thy birth  
  
  
Bridge  
Invisible the hope grows  
In the black where nobody knows  
We smile in the mystery  
In the night where nobody sees  
  
Invisible the hope grows  
In the black where nobody knows  
We smile in the mystery  
In the night where nobody sees  
  
Ending  
Invisible the hope grows  
In the black where nobody knows  
We smile in the mystery  
In the night where nobody sees  
  
We smile in the mystery  
In the night where nobody sees
