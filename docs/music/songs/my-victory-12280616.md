Verse 1  
  
You came for criminals  
And ev'ry Pharisee  
You came for hypocrites  
Even one like me  
You carried sin and shame  
The guilt of ev'ry man  
The weight of all I've done  
Nailed into Your hands  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Oh Your love bled for me  
Oh Your blood in crimson streams  
Oh Your death is Hell's defeat  
A cross meant to kill is my victory  
  
Verse 2  
  
Oh Your amazing grace  
I've seen and tasted it  
It's running through my veins  
I can't escape its grip  
In You my soul is safe  
You cover ev'rything  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Behold the Lamb of God  
Who takes away our sin  
Who takes away our sin  
The holy Lamb of God  
Makes us alive again  
Makes us alive again  
(REPEAT)  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Ending)  
Oh a cross meant to kill is my victory
