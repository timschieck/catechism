Verse 1  
  
The mystâ€™ry of the cross I cannot comprehend  
The agonies of Calvary  
You the perfect Holy One crushed Your Son  
Who drank the bitter cup reserved for me  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Your blood has washed away my sin  
Jesus thank You  
The Father's wrath completely satisfied  
Jesus thank You  
Once Your enemy now seated at Your table  
Jesus thank You  
  
Verse 2  
  
By Your perfect sacrifice I've been brought near  
Your enemy You've made Your friend  
Pouring out the riches of Your glorious grace  
Your mercy and Your kindness know no end  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Lover of my soul I want to live for You
