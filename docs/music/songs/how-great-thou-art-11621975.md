Verse 1  
  
O Lord my God  
When I in awesome wonder  
Consider all the worlds  
Thy hands have made  
I see the stars  
I hear the rolling thunder  
Thy pow'r thru'out  
The universe displayed  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Then sings my soul  
My Savior God to Thee  
How great Thou art  
How great Thou art  
Then sings my soul  
My Savior God to Thee  
How great Thou art  
How great Thou art  
  
Verse 2  
  
When through the woods  
And forest glades I wander  
And hear the birds  
Sing sweetly in the trees  
When I look down  
From lofty mountain grandeur  
And hear the brook  
And feel the gentle breeze  
  
Verse 3  
  
And when I think  
That God His Son not sparing  
Sent Him to die  
I scarce can take it in  
That on the cross  
My burden gladly bearing  
He bled and died  
To take away my sin  
  
Verse 4  
  
When Christ shall come  
With shout of acclamation  
And take me home  
What joy shall fill my heart  
Then I shall bow  
In humble adoration  
And there proclaim  
My God how great Thou art
