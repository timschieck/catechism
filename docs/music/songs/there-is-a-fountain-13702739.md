Verse 1  
There is a fountain filled with blood  
Drawn from Immanuel’s veins  
And sinners plunged beneath that flood  
Lose all their guilty stains  
  
Lose all their guilty stains  
Lose all their guilty stains  
And sinners plunged beneath that flood  
Lose all their guilty stains  
  
Verse 2  
The dying thief rejoiced to see  
That fountain in His day  
And there have I though vile as he  
Washed all my sins away  
  
Washed all my sins away  
Washed all my sins away  
And there have I though vile as he  
Washed all my sins away  
  
Verse 3  
Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood  
Shall never lose its pow’r  
Till all the ransomed church of God  
Are safe to sin no more  
  
Are safe to sin no more  
Are safe to sin no more  
Till all the ransomed church of God  
Are safe to sin no more  
  
  
Verse 4  
E’er since by faith I saw the stream  
Thy flowing wounds supply  
Redeeming love has been my theme  
And shall be till I die  
  
And shall be till I die  
And shall be till I die  
Redeeming love has been my theme  
And shall be till I die  
  
Verse 5  
When this poor lisping stamm’ring tongue  
Lies silent in the grave  
Then in a nobler sweeter song  
I’ll sing Thy power to save  
  
I’ll sing Thy power to save  
I’ll sing Thy power to save  
Then in a nobler sweeter song  
I’ll sing Thy power to save
