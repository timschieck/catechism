Verse 1  
Dark, dark is the valley  
Faint, the light at my feet  
But whatever may face me  
My God is all I need  
  
Verse 2  
Bright, bright are the treasures  
Life may offer to me  
But whatever the pleasure  
My God is all I need  
  
Chorus  
He is my strength when I cannot go on  
Peace when all my power is gone  
Hope, although the night is long and deep  
He is my song for He has rescued me  
Joy now He has set me free  
Praise! Praise to my Father be  
My God is all I need  
  
Verse 3  
Brief, brief are my days here  
Soon my journey complete  
But I look to my Saviour  
Where God has met my need  
Yes, He has met my need

My God is so big, so strong and so mighty  
There’s nothing my God cannot do  
My God is so big, so strong and so mighty  
There’s nothing my God cannot do  
  
The mountains are His, the valleys are His  
The stars are His handiwork too  
My God is so big, so strong and so mighty  
There’s nothing my God cannot do
