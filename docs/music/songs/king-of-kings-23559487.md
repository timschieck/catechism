VERSE 1
In the darkness we were waiting
without hope without light
Till from Heaven You came running
there was mercy in Your eyes
To ful - fil the law and prophets
to a virgin came the Word
From a throne of endless glory
to a cradle in the dirt

CHORUS
Praise the Father praise the Son
Praise the Spirit three in one
God of Glory majesty
Praise for - ever to the King of kings

VERSE 2
To re - veal the kingdom coming
and to reconcile the lost
To re - deem the whole cre - ation
You did not despise the cross
For even in Your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our sal - vation
Jesus for our sake You died


VERSE 3
And the morning that You rose
all of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
for the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
and the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all whoâ€™d come
to the Father are re - stored

VERSE 4
And the Church of Christ was born
then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this Gospel truth of old
shall not kneel shall not faint
By His blood and in His Name
in His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
who has resurrected me

TAG
Praise for - ever to the King of kings
