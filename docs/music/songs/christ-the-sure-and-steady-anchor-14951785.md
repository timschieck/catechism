Verse 1  
  
Christ the sure and steady anchor  
In the fury of the storm  
When the winds of doubt blow through me  
And my sails have all been torn  
  
Chorus 1  
  
In the suffering in the sorrow  
When my sinking hopes are few  
I will hold fast to the anchor  
It shall never be removed  
  
Verse 2  
  
Christ the sure and steady anchor  
While the tempest rages on  
When temptation claims the battle  
And it seems the night has won  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Deeper still then goes the anchor  
Though I justly stand accused  
I will hold fast to the anchor  
It shall never be removed  
  
Verse 3  
  
Christ the sure and steady anchor  
Through the floods of unbelief  
Hopeless somehow O my soul now  
Lift your eyes to Calvary  
  
Chorus 3  
  
This my ballast of assurance  
See His love forever proved  
All my hope is in the anchor  
It shall never be removed  
  
Verse 4  
  
Christ the sure and steady anchor  
As we face the wave of death  
When these trials give way to glory  
As we draw our final breath  
  
Chorus 4  
  
We will cross that great horizon  
Clouds behind and life secured  
And the calm will be the better  
For the storms that we endured  
  
Chorus 5  
  
Christ the shore of our salvation  
Ever faithful ever true  
We will hold fast to the anchor  
It shall never be removed
