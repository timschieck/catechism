Verse 1  
  
Here is love vast as the ocean  
Loving-kindness as the flood  
When the Prince of Life our Ransom  
Shed for us His precious blood  
(REPEAT)  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Who His love will not remember  
Who can cease to sing His praise  
He can never be forgotten  
Throughout Heav'n's eternal days  
  
Verse 2  
  
On the mount of crucifixion  
Fountains opened deep and wide  
Through the floodgates of God's mercy  
Flowed a vast and gracious tide  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Grace and love like mighty rivers  
Poured incessant from above  
Heav'n's peace and perfect justice  
Kissed a guilty world in love  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
No love is higher no love is wider  
No love is deeper no love is truer  
No love is higher no love is wider  
No love is like Your love O Lord  
(REPEAT 4X)  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Ending)  
Yes here is love  
Vast as the ocean  
Yes here is love  
Vast as the ocean  
(REPEAT)
