INTRO  
  
VERSE 1  
Though I have borne the fruit of sin  
Though I have felt the serpentâ€™s sting  
Though I de - serve the enmi - ty  
There in the garden, what do I see?  
Christ stands for me, Christ stands for me  
There in the garden, He stands for me  
Where I have fallen, He inter - cedes  
Hal - le - lujah, He stands for me  
  
TURNAROUND  
(me)  
  
VERSE 2  
With tears of blood, in longest night  
He took the cup ought to be mine  
Though in the darkness I fell a - sleep  
There in the garden, I wake to see  
Christ prays for me, Christ prays for me  
There in the garden, He prays for me  
Up on the hillside, Geth - sema - ne  
Hal - le - lujah, He prays for me  
  
  
INSTRUMENTAL  
(me)  
  
VERSE 3  
The Lamb of God will lead us home  
Where pain is passed and tears are gone  
E - den re - stored, as it should be  
There in the garden, oh, let me see  
Christ waits for me, Christ waits for me  
There in the Garden, He waits for me  
On golden shores of e - terni - ty  
Hal - le - lujah, He waits for me  
Hal - le - lujah, He waits for me  
  
OUTRO  
(me)
