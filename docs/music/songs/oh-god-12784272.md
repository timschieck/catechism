Verse 1  
  
In the valley oh God You're near  
In the quiet oh God You're near  
In the shadow oh God You're near  
At my breaking oh God You're near  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Oh God You never leave my side  
Your love stands firm through all my life  
  
Verse 2  
  
In my searching oh God You're near  
In my wandering oh God You're near  
When I feel alone oh God You're near  
At my lowest oh God You're near  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Height nor depth nor anything else  
Could pull us apart  
We are joined as one by Your blood  
Hope will rise as we become more  
Than conquerors through the One who loved the world  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Oh God You never leave my side  
Oh God Your love will stand firm through all my life
