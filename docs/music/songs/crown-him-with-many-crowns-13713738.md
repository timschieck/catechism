Verse 1

Crown Him with many crowns
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark how the heav'nly anthem drowns
All music but its own
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for Thee
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Thro' all eternity

Verse 2

Crown Him the Lord of love
Behold His hands and side
Rich wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified
All hail Redeemer hail
For Thou hast died for me
Thy praise and glory shall not fail
Thro'out eternity

Verse 3

Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
Who rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

Verse 4

Crown Him the Lord of heav'n
One with the Father known
One with the Spirit thro' Him giv'n
From yonder glorious throne
To Thee be endless praise
For Thou for us hast died
Be Thou O Lord thro' endless days
Adored and magnified
