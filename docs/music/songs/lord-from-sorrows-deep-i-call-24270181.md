Verse 1  
  
Lord from sorrows deep I call  
When my hope is shak- en  
Torn and ruined from the fall  
Hear my despe-ra-tion  
For so long I’ve pled and prayed  
God come to my res - cue  
Even so the thorn remains  
Still my heart will praise You  
  
Verse 2  
  
Storms within my troubled soul  
Questions without an -swers  
On my faith these billows roll  
God be now my shelter  
Why are you cast down my soul  
Hope in Him who saves you  
When the fires have all grown cold  
Cause this heart to praise You  
  
  
Verse 3  
  
Should my life be torn from me  
Every worldly plea- sure  
When all I possess is grief  
God be then my treasure  
Be my vision in the night  
Be my hope and refuge  
'Til my faith is turned to sight  
Lord my heart will praise You  
  
Chorus 1A  
  
Oh my soul put your hope in God  
My help my rock I will praise Him  
Sing oh sing through the raging storm  
You're still my God my salvation  
  
Chorus 1B  
  
Oh my soul put your hope in God  
My help my rock I will praise Him  
Sing oh sing through the raging storm  
You're still my God my salvation
