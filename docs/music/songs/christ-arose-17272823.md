    Verse 1  
  
Low in the grave He lay Jesus my Saviour  
Waiting the coming day Jesus my Lord  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Up from the grave He arose  
With a mighty triumph o'er His foes  
He arose a victor from the dark domain  
And He lives forever with His saints to reign  
He arose He arose  
Hallelujah Christ arose  
  
Verse 2  
  
Vainly they watch His bed Jesus my Saviour  
Vainly they seal the dead Jesus my Lord  
  
Verse 3  
  
Death cannot keep his prey Jesus my Saviour  
He tore the bars away Jesus my Lord
