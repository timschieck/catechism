Verse 1  
  
I need Thee every hour  
Most gracious Lord  
No tender voice like Thine  
Can peace afford  
  
Chorus 1  
  
I need Thee O I need Thee  
Every hour I need Thee  
O bless me now my Savior  
I come to Thee  
  
Verse 2  
  
I need Thee every hour  
Stay Thou near by  
Temptations lose their pow'r  
When Thou art nigh  
  
Verse 3  
  
I need Thee every hour  
In joy or pain  
Come quickly and abide  
Or life is vain  
  
Verse 4  
  
I need Thee every hour  
Most Holy One  
O make me Thine indeed  
Thou blessed Son
