Verse 1

Joyful joyful Lord we adore Thee
God of glory Lord of love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Opening to the sun above

Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light of day

Verse 2

All Thy works with joy surround Thee
Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays
Stars and angels sing around Thee
Center of unbroken praise

Field and forest vale and mountain
Flowery meadow flashing sea
Singing bird and flowing fountain
Call us to rejoice in Thee

Misc 1

(Pre-Chorus)
We sing in jubilation adoration to a joyful King
You are spinning You are singing
Zealous love over all Your children

Chorus 1

I got the joy I got the joy I got the joy
I got the joy I got the joy I got the joy
I got the joy I got the joy I got the joy
I got the joy I got the joy I got the joy

Verse 3

Mortals join the mighty chorus
Which the morning stars began
Father love is reigning over us
Brother love binds man to man

Ever singing march we onward
Victors in the midst of strife
Joyful music leads us sunward
In the triumph song of life

Misc 2

(Bridge)
In Your presence O God
There is fullness of joy
At Your right hand O God
There are pleasures evermore
