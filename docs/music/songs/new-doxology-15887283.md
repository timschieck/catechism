Verse 1  
  
Praise God from Whom all blessings flow  
Praise Him all creatures here below  
Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts  
Praise Father Son and Holy Ghost  
  
Verse 2  
  
Let earth and heavenly saints proclaim  
The pow'r and might of His great Name  
Let us exalt on bended knee  
Praise God the Holy Trinity

Praise God praise God  
Praise God Who saved my soul  
Praise God praise God  
Praise God from Whom all blessings flow  
  
Verse 3  
  
Praise to the King His throne transcends  
His crown and Kingdom never end  
Now and throughout eternity  
I'll praise the One Who died for me
