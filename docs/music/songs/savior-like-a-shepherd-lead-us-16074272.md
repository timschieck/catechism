Verse 1  
  
Saviour like a shepherd lead us  
Much we need thy tender care  
In thy pleasant pastures feed us  
For our use thy folds prepare  
Blessed Jesus blessed Jesus  
Thou hast bought us thine we are  
Blessed Jesus blessed Jesus  
Thou hast bought us thine we are  
  
Verse 2  
  
We are thine do thou befriend us  
Be the guardian of our way  
Keep thy flock from sin defend us  
Seek us when we go astray  
Blessed Jesus blessed Jesus  
Hear O hear us when we pray  
Blessed Jesus blessed Jesus  
Hear O hear us when we pray  
  
Verse 3  
  
Thou hast promised to receive us  
Poor and sinful though we be  
Thou hast mercy to relieve us  
Grace to cleanse and pow'r to free  
Blessed Jesus blessed Jesus  
Early let us turn to thee  
Blessed Jesus blessed Jesus  
Early let us turn to thee  
  
Verse 4  
  
Early let us seek thy favour  
Early let us do thy will  
Blessed Lord and only Saviour  
With thy love our beings fill  
Blessed Jesus blessed Jesus  
Thou hast loved us love us still  
Blessed Jesus blessed Jesus  
Thou hast loved us love us still
