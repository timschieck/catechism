    Verse 1  
  
Sing we the song of Emmanuel  
This the Christ who was long foretold  
Lo in the shadows of Bethlehem  
Promise of dawn now our eyes behold  
  
Chorus 1  
  
God Most High in a manger laid  
Lift your voices and now proclaim  
Great and glorious Love has come to us  
Join now with the hosts of heaven  
  
Verse 2  
  
Come we to welcome Emmanuel  
King who came with no crown or throne  
Helpless He lay the Invincible  
Maker of Mary now Maryâ€™s son  
  
Chorus 2  
  
O what wisdom to save us all  
Shepherds sages before Him fall  
Grace and majesty what humility  
Come on bended knee adore Him  
  
Verse 3  
  
Go spread the news of Emmanuel  
Joy and peace for the weary heart  
Lift up your heads for your King has come  
Sing for the Light overwhelms the dark  
  
Chorus 3  
  
Glory shining for all to see  
Hope alive let the gospel ring  
God has made a way He will have the praise  
Tell the world His name is Jesus  
  
Bridge  
  
Gloria Gloria  
Gloria Gloria
