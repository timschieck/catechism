Chorus 1

Who am I to know Your glory
Who am I to recognize
Your voice calling out
How could I be in Your story
God Who was an it and is to come
Who has won

I was dead in my sin but You came in

You made a way when there was no way
You covered heaviness with garments of praise
You wrote a song and
You're singing it over me
I feel a dead heart beating now
This revelation makes me wanna shout
That Jesus has been sent and everything is different

You turned ashes into beauty
You are for me not against me now
You found me somehow
You turn mourning into dancing
You turn weeping into a joyful noise
Oh rejoice

What manner of love that
You would call us sons and daughters
We cry Abba Father
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
I will never be the same
