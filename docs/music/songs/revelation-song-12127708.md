Verse 1  
  
Worthy is the Lamb Who was slain  
Holy holy is He  
Sing a new song to Him Who sits on  
Heaven's mercy seat  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Holy holy holy  
Is the Lord God Almighty  
Who was and is and is to come  
With all creation I sing  
Praise to the King of kings  
You are my ev'rything  
And I will adore You  
  
Verse 2  
  
Clothed in rainbows of living color  
Flashes of lightning rolls of thunder  
Blessing and honor strength and glory  
And power be to You the only wise King  
  
Verse 3  
  
Filled with wonder awestruck wonder  
At the mention of Your name  
Jesus Your name is power breath and living water  
Such a marv'lous mystery yeah
