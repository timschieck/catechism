Chorus 1

He's our Rescuer
He's our Rescuer
We are free from sin forevermore
Oh how sweet the sound
Oh how grace abounds
We will praise the Lord our Rescuer

Verse 1

There is good news for the captive
Good news for the shamed
There is good news for the one who walked away
There is good news for the doubter
The one religion failed
For the good Lord has come to seek and save

Verse 2

He is beauty for the blind man
Riches for the poor
He is friendship for the one the world ignores
He is pasture for the weary
Rest for those who strive
Oh the good Lord is the way the truth the life
Yes the good Lord is the way the truth the life

Misc 1

(Bridge)
So come and be chainless
Come and be fearless
Come to the foot of Calvary
There is redemption for every affliction
Here at the foot of Calvary
