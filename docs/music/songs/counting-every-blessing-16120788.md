Verse 1

I was blind now I'm seeing in colour
I was dead now I'm living forever
I had failed but You were my Redeemer
I've been blessed beyond all measure

Verse 2

I was lost now I'm found by the Father
I've been changed from a ruin to treasure
I've been given a hope and a future
I've been blessed beyond all measure

Chorus 1

I am counting every blessing
Counting every blessing
Letting go and trusting
When I cannot see
I am counting every blessing
Counting every blessing
Surely every season
You are good to me

Misc 1

(Interlude)
Oh You are good to me
Oh You are good to me

Verse 3

You were there in the valley of shadows
You were there in the depth of my sorrows
You're my strength my hope for tomorrow
I've been blessed beyond all measure

Misc 2

(Bridge)
Surely Your goodness pursues me
Surely Your heart is still for me
I will remember Your mercies
All my days
Through every storm and gale

Misc 3

(Ending)
For Your goodness I will ever praise You
Oh You are good to me
Oh You are good to me
