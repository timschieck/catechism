Verse 1  
  
I was blind now I'm seeing in colour  
I was dead now I'm living forever  
I had failed but You were my Redeemer  
I've been blessed beyond all measure  
  
Verse 2  
  
I was lost now I'm found by the Father  
I've been changed from a ruin to treasure  
I've been given a hope and a future  
I've been blessed beyond all measure  
  
Chorus 1  
  
I am counting every blessing  
Counting every blessing  
Letting go and trusting  
When I cannot see  
I am counting every blessing  
Counting every blessing  
Surely every season  
You are good to me  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Interlude)  
Oh You are good to me  
Oh You are good to me  
  
Verse 3  
  
You were there in the valley of shadows  
You were there in the depth of my sorrows  
You're my strength my hope for tomorrow  
I've been blessed beyond all measure  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Bridge)  
Surely Your goodness pursues me  
Surely Your heart is still for me  
I will remember Your mercies  
All my days  
Through every storm and gale  
  
Misc 3  
  
(Ending)  
For Your goodness I will ever praise You  
Oh You are good to me  
Oh You are good to me
