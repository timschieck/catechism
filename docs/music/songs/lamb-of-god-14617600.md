Verse 1

You came from heaven's throne
Acquainted with our sorrow
To trade the debt we owe
Your suff'ring for our freedom

Chorus 1

The Lamb of God in my place
Your blood poured out my sin erased
It was my death You died I am raised to life
Hallelujah the Lamb of God

Verse 2

My name upon Your heart
My shame upon Your shoulders
The pow'r of sin undone
The cross for my salvation

Misc 1

(Bridge)
There is no greater love
There is no greater love
The Savior lifted up
There is no greater love
