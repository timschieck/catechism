    Verse 1  
  
You came from heaven's throne  
Acquainted with our sorrow  
To trade the debt we owe  
Your suff'ring for our freedom  
  
Chorus 1  
  
The Lamb of God in my place  
Your blood poured out my sin erased  
It was my death You died I am raised to life  
Hallelujah the Lamb of God  
  
Verse 2  
  
My name upon Your heart  
My shame upon Your shoulders  
The pow'r of sin undone  
The cross for my salvation  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
There is no greater love  
There is no greater love  
The Savior lifted up  
There is no greater love
