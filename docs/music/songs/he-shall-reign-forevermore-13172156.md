Verse 1  
  
In the bleak mid-winter  
All creation groans  
For a world in darkness  
Frozen like a stone  
Light is breaking  
In a stable for a throne  
  
Chorus 1  
  
(And) He shall reign forevermore forevermore  
And He shall reign forevermore forevermore  
Unto us a Child is born  
The King of kings and Lord of lords  
And He shall reign forevermore forevermore  
  
Verse 2  
  
If I were a wise man  
I would travel far  
If I were a shepherd  
I would do my part  
But poor as I am  
I will give to Him my heart  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Here within a manger lies the One  
Who made the starry skies  
This baby born for sacrifice  
Christ the Messiah  
Into our hopes into our fears  
The Savior of the world appears  
The promise of eternal years  
Christ the Messiah
