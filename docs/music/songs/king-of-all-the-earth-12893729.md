Verse 1  
  
Your light shines through my darkness all darkness  
Like fire it consumes all my fears and my failures  
Your grace overwhelms like a flood  
Straight from Heaven  
Your hope opens eyes to the floodgates of Heaven  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Jesus King of all the earth  
Let the Heaven's proclaim Your worth  
One true God defeated the grave  
We join with angels and sing Your praise  
  
Verse 2  
  
Overthrown is the power of darkness all darkness  
Lost its hold when You came  
With Your kindness and Your goodness  
Your love breaks the chains  
Off my heart off my mind  
Your power sets free  
All the captives and You bring peace  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Oh my soul will sing  
Oh my soul will praise You  
(REPEAT)
