VERSE 1  
Rejoice the Lord is King  
Your Lord and King adore  
Rejoice give thanks and sing  
And triumph evermore  
  
REFRAIN  
Lift up your heart  
Lift up your voice  
Rejoice again I say rejoice  
  
VERSE 2  
Jesus the Savior reigns  
The God of truth and love  
When He had purged our stains  
He took His seat above  
  
VERSE 3  
His kingdom cannot fail  
He rules o'er earth and heav'n  
The keys of death and hell  
Are to our Jesus given  
  
VERSE 4  
Rejoice in glorious hope  
For Christ the Judge shall come  
And take His servants up  
To their eternal home
