Verse 1  
  
In tenderness He sought me  
Weary and sick with sin  
And on His shoulders brought me  
Back to His fold again  
While angels in His presence sang  
Until the courts of heaven rang  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Oh the love that sought me  
Oh the blood that bought me  
Oh the grace that brought me to the fold of God  
Grace that brought me to the fold of God  
  
Verse 2  
  
He died for me while I was sinning  
Needy and poor and blind  
He whispered to assure me  
I've found thee thou art Mine  
I'd never heard a sweeter voice  
It made my aching heart rejoice  
  
Verse 3  
  
Upon His grace I'll daily ponder  
And sing anew His praise  
With all adoring wonder  
His blessings I retrace  
It seems as if eternal days  
Are far too short to sing His praise
