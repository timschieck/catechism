Verse 1

There's no space that His love can't reach
There's no place where we can't find peace
There's no end to amazing grace

Verse 2

Take me in with Your arms spread wide
Take me in like an orphan child
Never let go never leave my side

Chorus 1

I am holding onto You
I am holding onto You
In the middle of the storm
I am holding on (I am)

Verse 3

Love like this O my God to find
I am overwhelmed with a joy divine
Love like this sets our hearts on fire

Misc 1

(Bridge)
This is my resurrection song
This is my hallelujah come
This is why it's to You I run
(REPEAT)

There's no space that His love can't reach
There's no place where we can't find peace
There's no end to amazing grace

Misc 2

(Ending)
I am
In the middle of the storm
I am holding on I am
