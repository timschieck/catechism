Verse 1  
  
There is one Gospel on which I stand  
For all eternity  
It is my story my Father's plan  
The Son has rescued me  
Oh what a Gospel oh what a peace  
My highest joy and my deepest need  
Now and forever He is my light  
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ  
  
Verse 2  
  
There is one Gospel to which I cling  
All else I count as loss  
For there where justice and mercy meet  
He saved me on the cross  
No more I boast in what I can bring  
No more I carry the weight of sin  
For He has brought me from death to life  
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ  
  
Verse 3  
  
There is one Gospel where hope is found  
The empty tomb still speaks  
For death could not keep my Saviour down  
He lives and I am free  
Now on my Saviour I fix my eyes  
My life is His and His hope is mine  
For he has promised I too will rise  
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ  
  
Verse 4  
  
And in this Gospel the church is one  
We do not walk alone  
We have His Spirit as we press on  
To lead us safely home  
And when in glory still I will sing  
Of this old story that rescued me  
Praise to my Saviour the King of life  
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Ending)  
And when in glory still I will sing  
Of this old story that rescued me  
Praise to my Saviour the King of life  
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ  
Praise to my Saviour the King of life  
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ  
I stand in the Gospel of Jesus Christ
