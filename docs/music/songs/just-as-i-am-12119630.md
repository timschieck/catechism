Verse 1  
  
Just as I am without one plea  
But that Thy blood was shed for me  
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee  
O Lamb of God I come I come  
  
Verse 2  
  
Just as I am and waiting not  
To rid my soul of one dark blot  
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot  
O Lamb of God I come I come  
  
Chorus 1  
  
I come broken to be mended  
I come wounded to be healed  
I come desperate to be rescued  
I come empty to be filled  
I come guilty to be pardoned  
By the blood of Christ the Lamb  
And I'm welcomed with open arms praise God  
Just as I am  
  
Verse 3  
  
Just as I am I would be lost  
But mercy and grace my freedom bought  
And now to glory in Your cross  
O Lamb of God I come I come  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Ending)  
Praise God just as I am  
Just as I am
