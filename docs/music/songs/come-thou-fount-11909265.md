VERSE 1  
Come Thou fount of ev'ry blessing  
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace  
Streams of mercy never ceasing  
Call for songs of loudest praise  
  
Teach me some me - lodious son - net  
Sung by flam - ing tongues a - bove  
  
Praise the mount I’m fixed up - on it  
Mount of Thy re - deeming love  
  
VERSE 2  
Here I raise mine Ebe - nezer  
Hither by Thy help I'm come  
And I hope by Thy good pleasure  
Safely to ar - rive at home  
  
Jesus sought me when a stran - ger  
Wand - ’ring from the fold of God  
  
He to rescue me from danger  
Inter - posed His precious blood  
  
  
VERSE 3  
O to grace how great a debtor  
Daily I’m con - strained to be  
Let Thy grace Lord like a fetter  
Bind my wand - ’ring heart to Thee  
  
Prone to wan - der Lord I feel it  
Prone to leave the God I love  
  
Here’s my heart Lord take and seal it  
Seal it for Thy courts a - bove
