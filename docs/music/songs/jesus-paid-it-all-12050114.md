Verse 1  
And I hear the Savior say  
Thy strength indeed is small  
Child of weakness watch and pray  
Find in Me thine all in all  
  
Chorus  
’Cause Jesus paid it all  
All to Him I owe  
Sin had left a crimson stain  
He washed it white as snow  
  
Instrumental  
  
Verse 2  
Lord now indeed I find  
Thy power and Thine a - lone  
Can change the leper’s spots  
And melt the heart of stone  
  
  
Verse 3  
And when before the throne  
I stand in Him com - plete  
Jesus died my soul to save  
My lips shall still re - peat  
  
Interlude 2  
Sin had left a crimson stain  
He washed it white as snow  
He washed it white as snow  
He washed it white as snow  
  
Bridge  
Oh praise the One Who paid my debt  
And raised this life up from the dead
