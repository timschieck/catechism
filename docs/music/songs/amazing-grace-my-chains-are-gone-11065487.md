Verse 1  
  
Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now I'm found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Verse 2  
  
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
Chorus 1  
  
My chains are gone I've been set free  
My God my Savior has ransomed me  
And like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love amazing grace  
  
Verse 3  
  
The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures  
  
Verse 4  
  
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow  
The sun forbear to shine  
But God who called me here below  
Will be forever mine  
Will be forever mine  
You are forever mine
