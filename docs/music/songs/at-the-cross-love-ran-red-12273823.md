Verse 1  
  
There's a place  
Where mercy reigns and never dies  
There's a place  
Where streams of grace flow deep and wide  
Where all the love I've ever found  
Comes like a flood comes flowing down  
  
Chorus 1  
  
At the cross at the cross  
I surrender my life  
I'm in awe of You I'm in awe of You  
Where Your love ran red and my sin washed white  
I owe all to You I owe all to You  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Interlude)  
Jesus  
  
Verse 2  
  
There's a place  
Where sin and shame are powerless  
Where my heart  
Has peace with God and forgiveness  
Where all the love I've ever found  
Comes like a flood comes flowing down  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Bridge)  
Here my hope is found  
Here on holy ground  
Here I bow down here I bow down  
Here arms open wide  
Here You saved my life  
Here I bow down here I bow (down)  
  
Misc 3  
  
(Ending)  
Jesus
