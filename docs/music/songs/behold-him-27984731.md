Verse 1  
  
He who was before there was light  
Walked across the pages of time  
He who made every living thing  
Behold Him  
He who heard humanity's cry  
Left His throne to wake as a child  
He became like the least of us  
Behold Him  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Jesus Son of God Messiah  
The Lamb the roaring Lion  
Oh be still and behold Him  
  
Verse 2  
  
He who dined with sinners and saints  
Healed the blind the lost and the lame  
Even now He is in our midst  
Behold Him  
He who chose a criminal's end  
Paid with blood to settle our debt  
Buried death as He rose to life  
Behold Him  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Jesus Son of God Messiah  
The Lamb the roaring Lion  
Oh be still and behold Him  
Jesus Alpha and Omega  
Our God the risen Savior  
Oh be still and behold Him  
  
Bridge 1  
  
Holy holy holy  
Is the Lord God Almighty  
Worthy worthy worthy  
To receive all praise
