Chorus 1

You will never run away You're forever mine
You will never run away You're by my side

Misc 1

(Interlude)
Oh oh oh

Verse 1

Love wide as galaxies love deeper than the sea
Countless as all infinity
Love like a shooting star tearing apart the dark
Shining for all eternity
Shining for all eternity

Chorus 2

You will never run away You're forever mine
You will never run away You're by my side
You will never run away You forever shine
You will never run away You're by my side

Verse 2

Love stronger than the grave
Love rolled the stone away
Rising with endless majesty
Love takes us by the hand
Love is the wildest dance
You are the joy and fight in me
You are the joy and fight in me

Misc 2

(Bridge)
Hearts open wide hands lifted high
Over the clouds up into the blue sky
Hearts open wide hands lifted high
Over the clouds up into the blue sky

Misc 3

(Ending)
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
