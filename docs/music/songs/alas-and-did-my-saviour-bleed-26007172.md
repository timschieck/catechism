    Verse 1  
A - las and did my Savior bleed  
And did my Sov’reign die  
Would He devote that sacred head  
For sinners such as I  
  
Chorus  
At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light  
And the burden of my heart rolled a - way  
It was there by faith I re - ceived my sight  
And now I am happy all the day  
  
Verse 2  
Was it for crimes that I have done  
He groaned upon the tree  
A - mazing pity, grace unknown  
And love be - yond de - gree  
  
Verse 3  
Well might the sun in darkness hide  
And shut His glories in  
When Christ the mighty Maker died  
For man the crea - ture’s sin  
  
Verse 4  
Thus might I hide my blushing face  
While Calv’ry’s cross ap - pears  
Dis - solve my heart in thankfulness  
And melt mine eyes to tears  
  
Verse 5  
But drops of grief can ne’er repay  
The debt of love I owe  
Here Lord I give myself away  
’Tis all that I can do
