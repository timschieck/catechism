Verse 1  
What love could re - member no wrongs we have done  
Om - niscient all knowing He counts not their sum  
Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore  
Our sins they are many His mer - cy is more  
  
Verse 2  
What patience would wait as we constantly roam  
What Father so tender is calling us home  
He welcomes the weakest the vilest the poor  
Our sins they are many His mer - cy is more  
  
Verse 3  
What riches of kindness He lavished on us  
His blood was the payment His life was the cost  
We stood 'neath a debt we could never af - ford  
Our sins they are many His mer - cy is more  
  
Chorus  
Praise the Lord  
His mercy is more  
Stronger than darkness new every morn  
Our sins they are many His mercy is more
