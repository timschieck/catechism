Verse 1

It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold

Peace on the earth good will to men
From heaven's all gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing

Verse 2

Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats
Through all the weary world

And man at war with man hears not
The love song which they bring
O hush the noise and cease the strife
And hear the angels sing

Chorus 1

(Oh) Glory to God in the highest
Glory to God evermore
Good news great joy for all
Melody breaks through the silence
Christ the Savior is born
Jesus the love song of God
(Jesus the love song of God)
