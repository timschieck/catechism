Verse 1  
  
God above all the world in motion  
God above all my hopes and fears  
And I don't care  
What the world throws at me now  
I'm gonna be alright  
  
Verse 2  
  
Hear the sound of the generations  
Making loud their freedom song  
All in all that the world  
Would know Your name  
We're gonna be alright  
  
Chorus 1  
  
'Cause I know my God saved the day  
And I know His word never fails  
And I know my God made a way for me  
(Salvation is here)  
(It's gonna be alright)  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Salvation is here  
Salvation is here and He lives in me  
Salvation is here  
Salvation that died just to set me free  
Salvation is here  
Salvation is here and He lives in me  
Salvation is here  
'Cause You are alive and You live in me  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Bridge)  
Salvation is here  
Salvation is here and He lives in me  
Salvation is here  
'Cause You are alive and You live in me  
(Salvation is here)
