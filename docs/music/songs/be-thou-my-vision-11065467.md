VERSE 1
Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
Nought be all else to me, save Thou art
Thou my best thought, by day or by night
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.

VERSE 2
Be Thou my wisdom, Thou my true word
I ever with Thee, Thou with me, Lord
Thou my great Father and I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

VERSE 3
Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
Thou mine inheritance now and always
Thou and Thou only, but first in my heart
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.

CHORUS
O God be my everything, be my delight
Be Jesus my glory, my soul satisfied (2x)

VERSE 4
High King of heaven, my victory won,
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
