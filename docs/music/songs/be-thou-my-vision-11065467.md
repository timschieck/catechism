VERSE 1  
Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart  
Nought be all else to me, save Thou art  
Thou my best thought, by day or by night  
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.  
  
VERSE 2  
Be Thou my wisdom, Thou my true word  
I ever with Thee, Thou with me, Lord  
Thou my great Father and I Thy true son;  
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.  
  
VERSE 3  
Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise  
Thou mine inheritance now and always  
Thou and Thou only, but first in my heart  
High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.  
  
CHORUS  
O God be my everything, be my delight  
Be Jesus my glory, my soul satisfied (2x)  
  
VERSE 4  
High King of heaven, my victory won,  
May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heaven's Sun!  
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,  
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
