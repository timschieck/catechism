Verse 1  
  
My one comfort both in life and death  
Is that I am not my own  
I was bought with blood and I confess  
I belong to You alone  
  
Chorus 1  
  
By the Father's good decree  
Jesus You've delivered me  
By Your spirit set me free  
To follow You  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Bridge)  
Jesus You have taken hold of me  
And in Your grip of grace I'm finally free
