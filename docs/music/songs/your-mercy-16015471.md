    Verse 1  
  
I was alone I couldn’t find my place  
'Til Heaven reached down Your love it called my name  
Out of my shame out of the dead of night  
Into a hope into Your marvelous light  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
It’s Your mercy I don’t deserve Your mercy  
That You would reach down for me  
And keep me as Your own  
For Your glory I'm living for Your glory  
And I will tell the story  
Of Your unfailing love  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Be glorified be lifted high  
In all my life be glorified  
  
Verse 2  
  
Though I may run though I may fall apart  
Chasing this world things that will break Your heart  
But faithful and true sure as the rising sun  
One thing is true one thing is sure to come  
  
Chorus 2  
  
Be glorified be lifted high  
In all my life be glorified  
Be glorified be lifted high  
In all my life be glorified  
  
Misc 2  
  
(Bridge)  
I’ve tasted and seen that You are good  
You’re walking with me just like You said You would  
And all that You say every word is true  
Oh whom should I trust Jesus I trust in You  
(REPEAT)
