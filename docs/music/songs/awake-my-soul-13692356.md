Verse 1  
  
Breathe on me breath of God breathe on me  
Breathe on me breath of God breathe on me  
I come alive I'm alive when You breathe on me  
I come alive I'm alive when You breathe on me  
  
Chorus 1  
  
Awake awake awake my soul  
God resurrect these bones  
From death to life for You alone  
Awake my soul  
  
Verse 2  
  
Speak to me Word of God speak to me  
Speak to me Word of God speak to me  
I come alive I'm alive when You speak to me oh  
I come alive I'm alive when You speak to me  
  
Misc 1  
  
(Spoken Words)  
Then He said to me  
Prophesy to these bones and say to them  
Dry bones hear the Word of the Lord  
This is what the sovereign Lord says to these bones  
I will make breath enter you  
And you will come to life  
So I prophesied as I was commanded  
As I was prophesying there was a noise  
A rattling sound  
And the bones came together  
Bone to bone and I looked  
And the tendons and the flesh appeared on them  
And skin covered them  
But there was no breath in them  
And then He said to me  
Prophesy to the breath  
Prophesy son of man and say to them  
Come from the four winds oh breath and breathe
