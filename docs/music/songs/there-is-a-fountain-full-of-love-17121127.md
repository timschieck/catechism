Verse 1

There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Emmanuel’s veins
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

Chorus 1

Lose all their guilty stains
Lose all their guilty stains
And sinners plunged beneath that flood
Lose all their guilty stains

Verse 2

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day
And there may I though vile as He
Wash all my sins away

Chorus 2

Wash all my sins away
Wash all my sins away
And there may I though vile as He
Wash all my sins away

Poured out on us

Verse 3

E’er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die

And shall be till I die
And shall be till I die
Redeeming love has been my theme
And shall be till I die
