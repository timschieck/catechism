VERSE 1  
When I survey the wondrous cross  
On which the Prince of glory died  
My richest gain I count but loss  
And pour contempt on all my pride  
  
VERSE 2  
Forbid it Lord that I should boast  
Save in the death of Christ my God  
All the vain things that charm me most  
I sacrifice them through his blood  
  
VERSE 3  
See from his head his hands his feet  
Sorrow and love flow mingled down  
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet  
Or thorns compose so rich a crown  
  
VERSE 4  
Were the whole realm of nature mine  
That were a present far too small  
Love so amazing so divine  
Demands my soul my life my all  
  
CHORUS  
Bless the Lord O my soul  
O my soul Worship His Holy Name  
Sing like never before O my soul  
I'll worship your holy name
