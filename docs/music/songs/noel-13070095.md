Verse 1

Love incarnate love divine
Star and angels gave the sign
Bow to babe on bended knee
The Savior of humanity
Unto us a Child is born
He shall reign forevermore

Chorus 1

Noel Noel
Come and see what God has done
Noel Noel
The story of amazing love
The light of the world given for us
Noel

Verse 2

Son of God and Son of man
There before the world began
Born to suffer born to save
Born to raise us from the grave
Christ the everlasting Lord
He shall reign forevermore
