title: The Nicene/Constantinople Creed
---

*Written 381*[^1]

I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.  

And \[we believe\] in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made.

Who, for us men and for our salvation, came down from heaven, adnw as incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.

And I believe in the Holy Spirit[^2], the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father and the Son;[^3] who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.

And I believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church, I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.

Amen.

[^1]: The Nicene Creed (325), adopted at the Council of Nicaea, served as the foundation for the revision that occurred at the Council of Constantinople (381).

[^2]: What was added was a clearer and explicit statement about the deity of the Holy Spirit, that He is God, expanding on the Nicene Creed which affirmed the simple statement, "And I believe in the Holy Spirit." And the concluding anathemas were removed: "But those who say, Once he was not, or he was not before his generation, or he came to be out of nothing, or who assert that he, the Son of God, is of a different *hypostatis* or *ousia*, or that he is a creature, or changeable, or mutable, the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes them."

[^3]: Although the phrase "and the Son" was added to the procession of the Holy Spirit after the Council of Constantinople (381), it is a truth affirmed by the Church in the West. This phrase, referred to as the *filioque*, was at the heart of the Great Schism (1054) between Eastern (Orthodox) and the Western Church.
