(c. Late 2nd, early 3rd Century)[^1]

I believe in God almighty  
And in Christ Jesus, his only son, our Lord  
Who was born of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary  
Who was crucified under Pontius Pilate and was buried  
And the third day rose from the dead  
Who ascended into heaven  
And sitteth on the right hand of the Father  
Whence he cometh to judge the living, and the dead  
 
And in the Holy Spirit  
The holy church  
The remission of sins  
The resurrection of the flesh  
The life everlasting
