title: "Irenaeus' Rule of Faith"
---

Written c. 190[^1]

...this faith: in one God, the Father Almighty, who made the heaven and the earth and the seas and all the things that are in them; and in one Christ Jesus, the Son of God, who was made flesh for our salvation; and in the Holy Spirit, who made known through the prophets the plan of salvation, and the coming, and the birth from a virgin, and the passion, and the resurrection from the dead, and the bodily ascension into heaven of the beloved Christ Jesus, our Lord, and his future appearing from heaven in the glory of the Father to sum up all things and to raise anew all flesh of the whole human race...

[^1]: This is the *regula fidei*. The "rule of faith" or "canon of truth" is the official church teaching that is grounded in and in agreement with Scripture and is considered a summary of the teaching of Scripture. This "faith" is what Christians are to believe, over against heresies. Additionally, this "rule" grounds and guides believers "in the correct exegesis of Scripture and the discernment of its unity and consistency." In other words, it provides a doctrinal grammar to interpret the Scriptures.
